# ENGRAM — Implementation Plan

**Companion to** `engram-spec.md` (Rev D) · **Status:** proposed · **Date:** 2026-08-04

This plan takes the spec as the requirement and answers the questions the spec left
open or answered inconsistently. Where it departs from the spec, the departure is
stated as an erratum with a reason. Nothing here changes the spec's goals.

---

## 0. Environment (verified)

| | Found | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| .NET SDK | `10.0.301` only (no 9.x) | Target `net10.0`. Spec says ".NET 9+" — satisfied and better for AOT. |
| Host | `osx-arm64`, Darwin 25.5 | Primary dev target. Native AOT on macOS needs Xcode CLT for the linker — verify day 1. |
| SQLite (system) | 3.51.0 | Above every floor we need. But we ship our own via SQLitePCLRaw, so the system copy only matters for `sqlite3` debugging. |
| Repo | **not a git repository** | `git init` before any code lands. |

## 1. Decisions (locked)

Forty-five architectural forks are locked below. Each is a decision, not an option.
Six of them were adjudicated with Fable.

### D1 — Packaging: AOT core, Roslyn sidecar, native libs in the data directory

- **`engram`** — Native AOT. Contains CLI, MCP server, temporal store, retrieval, and
  the universal + document analyzers. All pure managed, plus one native library it does
  not contain: SQLite. This paragraph used to claim SQLite was statically linked via
  `SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_e_sqlite3`; that is false, and was believed for long enough to
  ship an installer built on it. `SQLitePCLRaw.lib.e_sqlite3` 2.1.12 provides a static
  `e_sqlite3.a` for `browser-wasm` and no other RID, and its targets file wires the
  static reference under `'$(RuntimeIdentifier)' == 'browser-wasm'` alone. On every RID
  engram ships, the P/Invoke is resolved at runtime by `dlopen` against a library beside
  the executable. Measured: an `engram` copied away from its publish directory dies with
  `DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'e_sqlite3'` on first database
  open — `otool -L` does not show this, because a dlopen dependency is not a load
  command. Anything that installs, copies, or packages the binary carries
  `libe_sqlite3.dylib`/`.so` with it, and proves it did by running the *installed* copy
  at a command that opens a database.
- **`engram-analyzer-roslyn`** — separate self-contained trimmed/R2R binary. Spawned
  only by background indexing, speaks stdio JSON-lines, returns entities/edges/facts.
  **The core owns every DB write**; the sidecar never opens the database.
- **Optional native libs** (`llama.cpp` for LLamaSharp, `sqlite-vec`) live in
  `~/.engram/lib/`, fetched by `engram init --with-embeddings`, loaded from an explicit
  path — but by two different mechanisms, which this bullet originally conflated.
  `NativeLibrary.Load` is right for `llama.cpp` and tree-sitter, which the *managed* code
  P/Invokes into. `sqlite-vec` is not called from managed code at all: it is a SQLite
  loadable extension, so it goes in through `sqlite3_load_extension` —
  `SqliteConnection.EnableExtensions` then `LoadExtension(path)` — and registers a virtual
  table module on **that one connection**. Measured under AOT; see spike D in §1.5.
  For `llama.cpp` specifically, "loaded from an explicit path" is not one call: the ggml
  libraries must be `NativeLibrary.Load`-ed individually, in dependency order, *before*
  `NativeLibraryConfig.LLama.WithLibrary` names `libllama`. Their install names carry a
  version suffix (`@rpath/libggml.0.dylib`) that their filenames on disk do not, so a flat
  directory alone cannot satisfy `libllama`'s `@loader_path` lookup — loading each one first
  registers it under the name the lookup will use. Measured under AOT; see spike E in §1.5.

Rationale: the latency-critical paths — hooks, MCP start, recall — never touch Roslyn
or llama.cpp, so AOT's cold-start budget is preserved where it is actually spent.
Indexing tolerates a ~300 ms sidecar start amortized over a batch.

Cost accepted: the release artifact is two binaries and "single file, no runtime"
softens to *"single file for the core; optional features populate the home directory."*
A protocol version is embedded in both binaries; mismatch is a hard refusal.

**Status: verified by measurement (2026-08-04).** See §1.5 — the AOT core is viable and
the MCP SDK is AOT-clean, so no hand-rolled JSON-RPC fallback is needed. Roslyn itself
was *not* tested under AOT; the sidecar stands on the general reflection/MSBuild
argument, and is the one part of D1 still resting on reasoning rather than a number.

> **Erratum (spec §5.2):** "AOT-compatible workspace loading" for Roslyn is not a real
> thing. `MSBuildWorkspace` is MEF/reflection-driven and hostile to trimming. The
> sidecar makes it moot — and it should use plain `CSharpCompilation` over enumerated
> files, no MSBuild at all.

### D2 — Identity: `entity.id` is identity; `path` is a mutable addressing attribute

`path` stays `UNIQUE` and indexed (the prefix range scan is the spec's key retrieval
trick and must stay fast), and `fact.path` stays denormalized. But a rename cascades:
one transaction rewriting the path prefix on `entity` and `fact`. Old paths are
recorded as aliases in `entity.meta`. Exposed as exactly one operation,
`MoveSubtree(oldPrefix, newPrefix)`, so there is one code path to test.

> **Erratum (spec §4.1):** "facts are NEVER updated except the two closure columns"
> contradicts a denormalized `fact.path` under renames. Amend to: *belief content
> (predicate, body, object, validity) is immutable; addressing metadata follows the
> entity.*

> **Erratum (spec §5.2):** the claim that a deep analyzer "never re-keys" universal-tier
> entities does not survive contact with overloads, nested types, and qualified-name
> grammar. Plan for re-keys: ship an explicit **adopt/merge** step where the deep tier
> resolves a symbol to an existing entity by name + span, takes its id, corrects the
> path, and files the old path as an alias. A versioned path-grammar document is an
> M3 deliverable, not an assumption.

### D3 — FTS5: external-content, live facts only, trigger-maintained

Not contentless. The `'delete'` command needs the previously indexed values, and
external content has them by construction; facts are never hard-deleted so the content
table cannot dangle.

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE fact_fts USING fts5(
  body, predicate, content='fact', content_rowid='id',
  tokenize='porter unicode61');

CREATE TRIGGER fact_ai AFTER INSERT ON fact BEGIN
  INSERT INTO fact_fts(rowid, body, predicate) VALUES (new.id, new.body, new.predicate);
END;

CREATE TRIGGER fact_close AFTER UPDATE OF valid_to ON fact
  WHEN old.valid_to IS NULL AND new.valid_to IS NOT NULL BEGIN
  INSERT INTO fact_fts(fact_fts, rowid, body, predicate)
    VALUES ('delete', old.id, old.body, old.predicate);
END;

CREATE TRIGGER fact_ad AFTER DELETE ON fact BEGIN   -- compact only
  INSERT INTO fact_fts(fact_fts, rowid, body, predicate)
    VALUES ('delete', old.id, old.body, old.predicate);
END;
```

`subject_name` drops out of FTS (external content requires indexed columns to exist on
the content table) — join `entity` at query time instead.

Live-only is deliberate: letting superseded facts consume `seed_k` slots before
filtering pollutes ranking. History search is rare and served by a `LIKE` scan over
closed facts; an opt-in archive FTS table can come later if that ever hurts.

### D4 — Concurrency: WAL discipline, no lease, hooks never write SQLite

For M0/M1, ship all four of these together — they only work as a set:

1. `busy_timeout = 5000` on every connection.
2. **Every write transaction is `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.** A deferred transaction that
   upgrades to a writer yields `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT`, which busy-timeout cannot wait
   out. This is the classic WAL footgun and the single most likely source of
   intermittent failures.
3. The background indexer commits in chunks capped at ~50 ms / a few hundred rows.
   No long write transactions, ever.
4. **The `file-touched` hook does not open the database.** It writes one spool file per
   invocation under `~/.engram/queue/`, drained by the MCP server or the indexer, rather
   than appending to a single shared spool file: `FileMode.Append` is seek-then-write,
   not POSIX `O_APPEND`, so two concurrent hooks appending to one file can resolve the
   same end-of-file offset and lose a record, and the hook's < 10 ms budget rules out
   fixing that with lock-and-retry. This makes the < 10 ms budget unconditional rather
   than "true unless an indexer chunk is committing."

   **Measured** on the published binary (21.2 MB, macOS arm64, 120 samples after 20
   warmup, interleaved against a floor of `engram home` — same process, no database):

   | | p50 | p95 | p99 | vs floor |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | `home` (floor, no database) | 7.80 ms | 8.58 ms | 9.35 ms | — |
   | `file-touched` | 7.82 ms | 8.32 ms | 8.98 ms | **+0.02 ms** |
   | `session-start` (reads) | 10.18 ms | 10.79 ms | 11.13 ms | +2.38 ms |
   | `user-prompt` (writes) | 9.92 ms | 10.99 ms | 11.88 ms | +2.12 ms |

   Three things fall out, and the third is the one that matters.

   The budget holds, including at p99, and the unconditional part holds too: with an
   indexer-shaped writer committing 200-row `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` chunks back to back — 929
   chunks during the run — `file-touched` moved to p50 9.29 / p99 9.96 ms. Half a
   millisecond of shared disk, no tail. A hook that never opens the database cannot wait
   on a lock, which is the whole claim.

   The file-per-invocation design survives the case it was written for. Eight concurrent
   hooks (a multi-file edit) ran at p50 11.02 / p99 14.13 ms, and across the entire
   benchmark **580 invocations produced 580 spool files** — no record lost, at any width.

   **The hook's own work is unmeasurable; the budget is process start.** +0.02 ms is
   noise, and 99.7% of the 7.82 ms is spent before `RunFileTouched` is reached.

   Rule 4 is still not a stylistic preference about tidiness, but the arithmetic first
   written here was wrong and is worth correcting rather than quietly fixing. It read the
   +2.38 / +2.12 ms above as the cost of the open. Those are whole-hook deltas: the open
   *plus* reading facts and formatting a primer, or writing one. Isolating it — `probe`
   against two homes identical but for the presence of `engram.db`, which it skips when the
   file is absent — the open alone is **+1.46 ms** on the shipped binary, and +1.04 ms on
   the smaller spike-D binary. Against ~2.2 ms of headroom, a `file-touched` that opened the
   database would fit at p50 and sit on the line at p99.

   So the justification is not the p50 arithmetic; it is the word *unconditionally*. A hook
   that opens the database can wait on a lock, and `busy_timeout` is 5000 ms against a 10 ms
   budget — one contended open is a 500× overrun. The measurement above is what shows the
   rule buying that, and it would not survive the open. What threatens this budget in future
   is **binary size, not hook complexity**:
   spike A measured 3.44 ms of process start at 1.06 MB, and the same start now costs
   7.80 ms at 21.2 MB. That is a second, independent reason D1 keeps `sqlite-vec` and
   llama.cpp side-loaded rather than linked — quite apart from AOT-hostility, linking
   them would spend the hook budget on a lane this hook does not use.

Rule 4 is about `file-touched`, not about hooks as a category, and the distinction is
load-bearing enough to state: everything justifying it — per-edit frequency, the
concurrent-append race, the unconditional sub-10 ms budget — describes that hook and
only that hook. The primer hooks (`session-start`, `subagent-start`) fire once per
session or per spawn, take a read, and close it. They may open the database, and must,
because a primer sourced from a hardcoded list stops agreeing with recall the moment a
fact is forgotten — it keeps announcing memory the user has cleared. Measured over 3
rounds of 40 invocations of the published binary: 10.6 ms hardcoded vs 12.1 ms reading
the store. Note the hardcoded version already exceeded 10 ms on process start alone,
which is the clearest evidence that the sub-10 ms budget was never a claim about these
hooks.

"No hook writes" was asserted here as the part that generalizes. It does not, and the
correction is worth more than the rule was. `user-prompt` writes, because it is the only
place a fact the user states in passing can be caught at all — the M0 telemetry says the
model does not call `engram_remember`, so a capture the model has to opt into is a capture
that does not happen. It fires once per message a human types, which is not remotely the
per-edit rate rule 4 was written against, and it takes one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction
held for the length of an insert. Measured the same way, 3 rounds of 40 invocations of
each published binary: 13.1–13.4 ms writing to the store against 11.1–11.4 ms writing a
JSON file, so about +2 ms on a process start that dominates both.

What actually generalizes is narrower and is the rule to keep: **a hook opening the
database is a decision with a measurement behind it, never a default.** Two have earned
it. `file-touched` has not and will not — its budget is the one rule 4 describes.

Salience bumps are batched in memory and flushed best-effort — a dropped bump is
harmless, and it is not worth contending for the write lock.

No lease, no queue table, no daemon: a lease is a daemon in denial and reintroduces
the liveness problems (stale lease after a kill) that SQLite was chosen to avoid.

**Watched failure mode:** WAL checkpoint starvation. Long-lived MCP read snapshots
during a bulk index block checkpointing; the WAL grows unbounded and every reader
slows. Mitigations: keep read transactions short (no lingering snapshot in the MCP
loop) and run `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` after each bulk indexing phase. **M1 must
include a test that measures hook p99 under a concurrent bulk index.** If that
measurement ever fails, the pre-planned escalation is the single-writer lease — but it
is not built until then.

### D5 — Contradiction detection: cut from v1

Ship no automated cross-predicate contradiction detection. Keep the `contradicts`
edge type and the ⚠ recall rendering, and let the *agent* write those edges via
`remember` / `revise`.

The same-subject-same-predicate collision path (§4.3 step 2) already covers the case
that matters, and §12's own proposed narrowing of step 3 ("same subject+predicate with
differing objects only") collapses step 3 into a subset of step 2 — the spec has
already argued itself out of the feature. A false ⚠ costs tokens *and* trust on every
recall that surfaces it, and negation heuristics over ≤ 60-token free-text bodies will
misfire constantly ("uses JWT" vs "doesn't use JWT for refresh" is not a
contradiction). The agent reading both facts side by side in recall output is the
detector, and it is free.

Revisit in M4 with embeddings, gated on real transcripts showing conflicts the agent
missed.

### D6 — Sequencing: prove adoption before building the code graph

The spec's §1.2 says every predecessor died because *the LLM never called the memory
tool*. M1 as specified spends its entire budget before producing one bit of evidence
on that question. So the plan inserts an **M0 adoption probe** ahead of it, and holds
M3 (the most expensive milestone, and the one carrying the D1 sidecar risk) behind
adoption data. See §3.

### D7 — Isolation: nothing is ever hardcoded to the installed instance

Every filesystem path in Engram derives from a single resolved **home root**, in this
precedence order: `--home <path>` flag → `ENGRAM_HOME` env var → `~/.engram`. There is
one resolver, and no other code may compute a path from `$HOME`.

This makes a fully isolated instance a one-liner (`ENGRAM_HOME=/tmp/e1 engram init`) and
makes every layer testable without risking the user's real memory:

- **The installer takes explicit targets.** `engram install claude-code
  --settings-path <file> --mcp-config <file>`, so a sandbox install writes hook and MCP
  registration into a throwaway settings file, never `~/.claude/settings.json`. The
  real paths are defaults, not assumptions.
- **Integration tests each get a fresh temp home** and assert against real database
  files, not mocks — temporal semantics and WAL concurrency cannot be honestly tested
  against an in-memory fake.
- **A hard test guard:** the test fixture refuses to run if the resolved home is the
  real `~/.engram`, failing loudly rather than writing a byte. The failure mode here is
  destroying the user's accumulated memory, so it gets a belt and braces.
- **A lint test** scans the sources for hardcoded `.engram`, `$HOME`, and `~/.claude`
  literals outside the one resolver and the one installer default, and fails the build.
  This is the only thing that keeps the rule true after month one.
- **End-to-end agent tests** additionally set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to a temp directory,
  so a test session's hooks, MCP registration, and transcripts are all disposable.

Portability (spec §2.2, "copy the directory to move machines") falls out of the same
resolver for free.

### D8 — Diagnostics and repair, split along the derived/authored line

The spec has `doctor` but no repair. Both ship, and the boundary between them is the
one `compact` already uses: **derived state is repairable, authored truth is not.**

`engram doctor` — read-only, exit code reflects severity, one screen of actionable
output. Checks: `PRAGMA integrity_check`; FTS `'integrity-check'`; schema version vs.
binary; orphan facts (subject with no entity) and orphan salience rows; facts closed
with no `supersession` row and vice versa; `superseded_by` pointing at a missing fact;
`fact.path` disagreeing with its subject entity's path; WAL size and last checkpoint;
stale spool-queue entries; hook registration present *and* its binary path still valid;
config lint; embedder state; facts well over the 60-token target.

`engram repair` — **dry-run by default**, `--apply` to execute, and it snapshots the
database first regardless. It may only rebuild what can be derived again: the FTS index
(`INSERT INTO fact_fts(fact_fts) VALUES('rebuild')`), salience scores, `fact.path`
re-derived from the owning entity, orphan salience rows, WAL checkpoint and VACUUM, and
re-attaching a repo whose disk location moved.

It may **never** create, alter, or delete a fact body, a predicate, a validity window,
or a supersession row. If the only way to fix something is to invent or destroy a
belief, `repair` reports it and stops — that is the user's decision, not the tool's. A
database corrupted beyond that rule is a restore-from-backup situation, which is why
`export` and the pre-repair snapshot exist.

### D9 — Testing: five tiers, and the integration tier is the one that matters

Unit tests cannot establish the things most likely to break Engram. Its risks are
temporal invariants over long histories, several OS processes contending for one SQLite
file, an AOT binary behaving differently from the JIT build that passed CI, and an MCP
tool surface whose *output text* is a contract with a language model. All four are
integration concerns. So the integration tier is the primary tier, not a supplement.

| Tier | Runs | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **1 · Unit** | every build | Pure logic — path resolution, salience math, token estimation, packing. Fast, no I/O. |
| **2 · Integration** | every build | Real SQLite files in a disposable home. Temporal semantics, FTS sync, retrieval fusion, doctor/repair, installer merges. **The bulk of the suite lives here.** |
| **3 · End-to-end** | every push | Drives the *published AOT binary* as a subprocess — CLI verbs, `engram mcp` over real stdio JSON-RPC, `engram hook …` emitting real hook payloads. |
| **4 · Stress & concurrency** | nightly + before release | N processes against one database; hook latency percentiles under bulk index; WAL growth; kill-mid-write recovery. |
| **5 · Adoption telemetry** | continuous, real sessions | Not pass/fail. Recall coverage rate over time — §12 of the spec calls this *the* health metric. |

Tier 3 gets its own project (`tests/Engram.EndToEnd.Tests`) because it depends on a
publish step and is too slow for the inner loop. It is not optional: the JIT build
passing proves nothing about the artifact that actually ships, and trimming failures are
exactly the kind that appear only in the published binary.

Specific things that must have integration tests, because each is a known way this
design fails quietly:

- **Temporal invariants, property-based.** Generate random sequences of
  remember/revise/forget/reindex and assert after every step: no fact ever disappears;
  at most one live fact per (subject, predicate); every closed fact has exactly one
  supersession row; every `superseded_by` resolves; history chains terminate. Chosen
  examples will not find the ordering bug that a thousand generated sequences will.
- **Concurrency, with real processes.** Not threads — processes, because that is what
  ships: several `engram mcp` servers, hook invocations, and a detached indexer against
  one database. Assert no `SQLITE_BUSY` surfaces to a caller, hook p99 stays under
  budget during a bulk index, and the WAL gets truncated rather than growing without
  bound (D4's watched failure mode).
- **Crash recovery.** `SIGKILL` mid-write, reopen, assert the database is consistent and
  no partial fact is visible. WAL should handle this; asserting it is cheap.
- **The recall output contract.** §6.2's format is read by a model, so it is an
  interface. Golden-file tests, changed deliberately and reviewed as an API change.
- **MCP conformance.** Drive the real server over stdio: `initialize`, `tools/list`,
  every tool called with valid and invalid arguments, and the `remember`-without-reason
  soft error that §9 says must be structurally enforced.
- **Repair drills.** Corrupt the FTS index, the salience table, and `fact.path`
  independently; assert `doctor` names each and `repair --apply` fixes it with every
  fact body and supersession row bit-identical afterward.
- **Installer round-trips** against fixtures carrying foreign hooks and unrelated
  settings — already built, and the pattern for everything that touches user files.
- **Migration.** Every schema version bump ships with a test that opens a database
  written by the previous version and reads it correctly.
- **Hard latency deadlines belong in tier 4, not tier 3.** A wall-clock assertion in the
  every-push tier competes with whatever else that tier happens to be running, so a
  hardcoded deadline there is unsound by construction. Tier 3 asserts a median over
  repeated samples as a smoke check; tier 4 owns real percentiles under controlled load.

Cross-platform matters too: the spec promises four RIDs, so CI runs the full suite on
osx-arm64 and linux-x64 at minimum. A test that only ever ran on the author's Mac is a
claim, not evidence.

### D10 — Zero manual init is a goal, not a side effect

A primary reason this tool exists rather than an existing one is that memory must
accrue without the user ever running an init command for a repository. The spec already
has the machinery — SessionStart-triggered indexing, `auto_index_on_session_start`, a
registry keyed on normalized git remote so a moved or re-cloned checkout reattaches —
but it describes them as implementation detail. They are the requirement.

Stated properly: **an unfamiliar repository must become useful memory with no user
action, ever.** That has a consequence worth naming, because it is the cost of the
virtue: a tool that indexes every repository you happen to open will accumulate memory
about repositories you looked at once and never think about again. Manual init is at
least a deliberate judgment about what deserves remembering; removing it means Engram
owns that judgment. So zero-init requires a matching opt-*out* — a per-repo ignore that
is one command and is honoured by the registry, plus `compact --path` to discard a
branch that turned out not to matter.

### D11 — Session memory: what the model would otherwise hold in context

Long-term memory is not the only thing missing from existing tools. The model also
needs somewhere to put **working state it would otherwise carry in context and lose** —
to compaction, or to a subagent that returns an incomplete report, or to a subagent that
dies. This is durable and later recallable like any other fact, but its primary read
window is the session that wrote it.

- **A new root, `/sessions/<session-id>/…`,** with subagent-written facts one level
  deeper at `/sessions/<session-id>/<agent>/…`. `[taxonomy] roots` is config, so this
  costs a config line and routing rules; the schema does not move.
- **Keyed on the MCP server's session id.** §1.5's research established that the
  server's process lifetime is exactly one Claude Code session, and subagents share the
  parent's MCP connection — so they write under the same session key by construction.
  Spec §8's `via_subagent` marker stops being provenance decoration and becomes the
  thing that distinguishes which worker learned what.
- **Recall needs a session lane.** Facts under the current session outrank everything
  else by default. Working memory that competes on equal terms with a year of project
  memory is not working memory.
- **A different distillation bar.** *"Checked the WAL-starvation theory, not the cause"*
  is a legitimate working note and not a ≤ 60-token durable truth. Session facts are
  exempt from the distillation target, though not from the recall token budget.
- **They age by salience, never by deletion.** A year-old session note still exists; it
  simply stops outranking anything. This is what keeps the branch from turning recall
  into an archaeology dig.

  That is about *time*, and it was over-read as being about retraction. Session notes
  spent M0 in a per-session JSONL file, a format with no notion of a closed record at
  all, which made a note the one kind of memory that could be written and never taken
  back: `engram_forget` refused them by construction, and a note the model got wrong
  stayed recallable for good. Notes are ordinary facts now, closed by the same
  `FactStore.Forget` as everything else. Aging still never deletes; a user still can.

- **The path segment is the `session` row id, not the host's session string.** D11 wrote
  `/sessions/<session-id>/…` when the session id was a file name. As a path segment it is
  a hazard: the host's identifier is opaque text that may contain a `/`, and a segment
  that invents a level of hierarchy silently reparents a whole session's notes. Slugging
  it instead lets two distinct sessions collide on one segment, which at the leaf is not
  a display problem but one session's note superseding another's. `session.external_id`
  is already the bridge between the host's string and a foreign key (D19), so the path
  uses the row id and reads names back through the entity table.

- **A note's leaf is a fingerprint of its own statement.** `ux_fact_live` is unique over
  subject and predicate, so a root holding many independent statements needs a
  per-statement address or each new note closes the last. Two behaviours then fall out of
  addressing rather than policy code: recording the same statement twice in one session
  returns the existing handle instead of writing a supersession row that claims a belief
  changed when the text is identical, and two sessions reaching the same conclusion keep
  two notes, because the session segment sits above the fingerprint.
- **Subagents need their own primer, and it has a trap.** Spec §8 says subagent sharing
  is "about provenance and scope, not transport" because subagents inherit the MCP
  server. That is transport-correct and adoption-blind: **`SessionStart` hooks do not
  fire for subagents**, so a subagent inherits the tools while knowing nothing about
  them. Under D12 — where adoption needs intervention even for the main agent — a
  subagent that never saw a primer will not write session memory, which is most of D11's
  point. So the hook suite gains `SubagentStart`, emitting a compact primer naming the
  session and the tools.

  The trap, confirmed first-hand by this user across two of their own plugin repos:
  **`SubagentStart` silently discards plain stdout**; only the
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` envelope is delivered, with no error and no log
  line. `SessionStart` accepts bare stdout, so the habit formed on one event actively
  misleads on the other. Our `session-start` already emits the envelope, which means
  nothing in our own code would have warned us.

  Note also that two plugins must not both rewrite the `Agent` tool's input via
  `PreToolUse` to reach subagents — that is undefined when both fire, whereas multiple
  hooks' `additionalContext` on one event aggregates safely. `SubagentStart` is the
  supported channel; input rewriting is not.

The payoff is testable in a way the rest of the design is not: write a fact, get
compacted, recall it. That is the tool visibly paying for itself inside a single
session, rather than a bet on value that only materializes next week.

#### The subagent primer, and the one thing it is built to find out

`SubagentStart` now delivers a shorter primer than `SessionStart` — no examples, since a
subagent's context is spent on its task — differing in one point: a subagent reports back
through a summary, and a summary is lossy by construction, so anything it learned that did
not fit the report is gone at handoff unless it was written down. That is precisely the gap
this decision exists to close, so it is what the primer says.

One thing is deliberately not assumed. **Whether a subagent is handed its parent's
`session_id` or one of its own decides whether session memory is shared across the spawn
for free.** If it matches, a subagent's writes land in the parent's file and sharing needs
no further work; if it does not, a parent id has to be threaded through explicitly. Rather
than guess, the hook records the session id it was handed along with `agent_id` and
`agent_type`, so the first real probe run answers it by comparing those records against the
`session-start` ones.

The envelope is the whole risk here, and it fails silently: bare stdout is discarded on this
event while `SessionStart` accepts it, so the habit formed there actively misleads. The E2E
test therefore asserts the parsed envelope rather than the exit code — verified by setting
`hookEventName` to `SessionStart`, the exact copy-paste mistake this invites, and confirming
the test fails.

### D12 — Adoption evidence from two sibling tools already on this machine

Both were inspected directly (2026-08-04). The findings bear on the spec's central
premise more than anything else in this plan.

**Structured authoring is the part that goes unused.** MemPalace holds 67,936 drawers of
unstructured capture. Its knowledge graph — append-only facts, supersession,
invalidation, timeline, i.e. structurally the closest analogue to *all of Engram §4* —
reports `{entities: 0, triples: 0, current_facts: 0, expired_facts: 0}`. Never called
once, in a mature installation, despite the tool embedding its own usage protocol in
every response. Meanwhile its "diary" room is the only room present in all 18 wings,
including wings whose entire contents are diary entries.

Set beside Codebase-Memory — auto-indexed, asks nothing of the model, 41 projects and up
to 112k edges — a mechanism appears:

| Asks of the model | Example | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Nothing | auto-indexed code graph | heavy |
| Almost nothing | freeform diary note | universal |
| Distill, pick a predicate, justify a revision | structured fact + supersession | **zero** |

**Adoption appears inversely proportional to what the tool demands of the model**, and
Engram's authoring path is the most demanding of the three. This does not make the design
wrong, but it moves the riskiest assumption: *"will the agent call recall"* is the
question M0 was built to answer, and *"will the agent author structured facts"* is
probably the harder one. Both must be measured separately — a tool can look adopted in
aggregate while its authored core sits at zero. The probe already reports recall,
remember, and digest independently; that separation is load-bearing, not cosmetic.

**Every memory tool on this machine needed an external intervention to get used.**
Verified from `~/.claude/settings.json`: the only configured hooks are a SessionStart
reminder and a `PreToolUse` **gate that blocks `Grep|Glob`** until memory is consulted —
both hand-built for Codebase-Memory. MemPalace ships only capture hooks
(`Stop`/`SessionEnd`/`PreCompact`), no injection, which is why the user's global
`CLAUDE.md` carries a hand-written instruction to search it before answering.

Spec §6.3 states the primer "is the reason the LLM actually uses the tools." That is a
hypothesis, and the evidence here says it is probably insufficient on its own. The
intervention that demonstrably worked is the strongest one: a hard gate. So M0 should
baseline primer-only *first* — a clean measurement of the weakest lever — and treat a
`PreToolUse` gate as a planned, already-proven escalation rather than a last resort. The
spec text should be softened to match the plan's own skepticism.

**Three of our decisions are confirmed by other people's production scars**, which is
the cheapest possible validation:

- A **writer-lease** design produced exactly the liveness bugs D4 predicted, across five
  patch rounds, plus a hook that deadlocked against an open database client and left the
  host waiting on it. D4 rejected leases and forbade hooks touching the database; treat
  that as a validated prediction rather than a hypothetical.
- **Hardcoded and singleton path bugs** hit production three separate ways — a module
  singleton reading the wrong database under a rotating path, a hardcoded filename
  ignoring configured path, and symlinked/case-variant paths producing duplicate caches.
  D7's lint test is the mechanical check that catches that class at build time.
- A **contradiction detector documented as live but never wired up** was caught by public
  audit. D5 cut ours and said so; that is the right shape.

One place we are already better and should protect it: Codebase-Memory's `index_status`
returns no timestamp and no freshness signal at all. Engram's `file_state.blob_sha` /
`indexed_at` design (§5.3) is a genuine improvement over a real, actively used tool.

### D13 — Distribution: a build artifact cannot ship in a remote marketplace

Engram ships as a Claude Code plugin (marketplace at the repository root, plugin under
`plugin/`). The original arrangement worked locally: a build script published the AOT
binary into a gitignored `plugin/bin/`, and `.mcp.json` and `hooks.json` reached it
through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.

That arrangement does not survive the move to a **remote** marketplace, which is the
intended end state. Claude Code clones the repository, so anything the manifests
reference must be committed — but committing a ~11 MB binary for each of four runtime
identifiers, on every version bump, makes the history unusable in a handful of releases.
There is also no documented mechanism for selecting a per-platform path, so `.mcp.json`
can name exactly one `command`.

**This is now built, and it was a correctness fix before it was a distribution one.** The
bundled binary had a defect nobody was looking for, found by reasoning about what
installing the plugin would do to the daemon already running.

A bundled copy lives under the version-pinned cache, so its path changes on every version
bump: `…/0.2.0/bin/engram` becomes `…/0.3.0/bin/engram`. D14's daemon proves ownership by
executable path before it will signal anything — correctly, since that is what stops it
killing a recycled pid. After an upgrade the new binary therefore cannot recognise the
running server as its own. It declines to replace it (right), fails to bind the port
(inevitable), asks `/health`, gets the *old* version back, and returns
`PortHeldByStranger`. `ensure-server.sh` swallows that by design. **The old daemon runs
forever, the new one never starts, and memory silently disappears after an upgrade** —
precisely when someone is most likely to blame the new version for something else.

A stable install path removes the failure rather than defending against it. With
`~/.local/bin/engram` the path does not change across upgrades, so ownership resolves, the
version check finds a stale daemon, and it is replaced exactly as intended.

So the plugin now ships **no binary at all**. `hooks/resolve-engram.sh` locates one —
`$ENGRAM_BIN`, then `$HOME/.local/bin/engram`, then `PATH` — and `hooks/engram-exec.sh`
`exec`s it. PATH is checked last on purpose: a hook inherits whatever environment launched
Claude Code, and a GUI launch can carry a minimal PATH that never included `~/.local/bin`.
`.mcp.json` needed no change, since it names a URL rather than a command — a second,
unplanned dividend of D14.

The two constraints below were written for a launcher that *fetches*. This one resolves
instead, which satisfies both trivially: no network on any path, and the hot path costs
three `stat` calls. They still apply the day fetching is added.

- **Pin the binary version inside the launcher.** The launcher is versioned with the
  plugin; the binary it fetches is not. Naming the exact expected version is what makes
  skew impossible rather than merely unlikely (the same reasoning as D1's protocol
  version between core and sidecar).
- **Never fetch on the hot path.** `file-touched` has a sub-10 ms budget (D4); a
  launcher that might download 11 MB cannot sit in front of it. Bootstrapping belongs in
  `SessionStart`, which runs once per session and can report a missing binary as
  `additionalContext` — a silent failure here would look exactly like the agent choosing
  not to use memory, which is the one confusion D12 says we cannot afford.

The cost is that the plugin is no longer self-contained: installed from a marketplace with
no binary present, it does nothing. That is why the missing-binary case is the one thing
`ensure-server.sh` says out loud. Every other hook fails silent — a hook that errors is
worse than one that no-ops — but `SessionStart` has a channel that reaches someone, and
silence there is indistinguishable from memory simply not working, which D12 names as the
one confusion we cannot afford. The E2E test asserts that message appears, and asserts the
success path stays completely silent, since anything printed there becomes a line of the
agent's prompt every session.

### D14 — A supervised local HTTP server replaces stdio

Engram serves MCP over local HTTP from a long-lived process managed by `engram start`,
`engram stop`, and `engram status`. The stdio transport is retired, not kept as a
fallback.

**Why, in order of weight.** A per-session stdio process cannot hold anything warm: at
M4 a ~640 MB GGUF embedding model would reload on every session, which is fatal to §7's
design. Claude Code reconnects HTTP and SSE servers — five attempts with exponential
backoff mid-session, three on initial connect — but **does not reconnect stdio servers
at all**, so today a crashed server is silently gone for the rest of a session and looks
identical in telemetry to the agent losing interest. And the streamable-HTTP transport
lets the *server* mint an `Mcp-Session-Id` at `initialize`, which is a real per-session
identity rather than the process-lifetime proxy we have been leaning on.

Write concurrency is explicitly **not** the motivation; D4 already handles that.

> **Amends spec §2.2**, which requires "zero services: no daemons required for core
> operation." That is no longer true, deliberately. The cost is a lifecycle to supervise
> and a crash that takes every session with it rather than one; the benefits above are
> judged to outweigh it, and `status` plus auto-start are what make it tolerable.

**Port.** A fixed default, overridable through the plugin's `userConfig`. Ephemeral
ports are impossible here — `${VAR}` in `.mcp.json` resolves from the environment Claude
Code itself was launched with, so a port chosen afterwards cannot be expressed — but
ephemeral ports were never a requirement. `engram start` fails loudly when the port is
occupied by something that is not us.

**Exposure.** Bind 127.0.0.1 only, and reject requests carrying an `Origin` header. A
loopback listener is reachable by local processes that cannot read the filesystem, so
"it's only localhost" is not on its own a sufficient posture. An optional bearer token
may be supplied later through `userConfig` with `sensitive: true`, which stores it in the
OS keychain rather than in `settings.json`.

**Identity and staleness.** `~/.engram/engram.pid`, mode 0600, holding pid, port, start
time, and version. The PID file is a hint; identity must be proven before any process is
killed, because "kill whatever holds the port" and "kill our own wedged server" are
identical in code and very different in consequence.

| PID file | Process | Identity | Health | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| absent | — | — | — | start |
| present | dead | — | — | stale file → remove, start |
| present | alive | ours | answers with our pid+version | already running → exit 0 |
| present | alive | ours | no answer, or wrong version | **orphan → kill, clean up, start** |
| present | alive | **not ours** | — | PID was reused → remove file, start; **never kill** |
| — | — | — | port held by a stranger | report clearly; **never kill** |

Identity is proven without asking the process anything — the executable path matches ours
*and* the recorded start time matches the live process's — because the orphan case is
precisely a process too wedged to answer a health check. Health then separates
alive-and-well from alive-and-wedged, once identity is already settled.

Two concurrent `engram start` invocations need no lock: whoever binds the port wins, and
the loser finds a healthy server and exits 0. The OS already provides the mutex.

**Starting it is the plugin's job, not the user's and not the agent's.** The
`SessionStart` hook spawns the daemon detached and does not wait on readiness; Claude
Code retries an initial HTTP connection three times with exponential backoff, which
comfortably covers the gap. Nothing asks a human to run a command in the normal path.

An `http`-type MCP entry has no `command`, and `alwaysLoad` only blocks on *connecting* —
it never starts anything. So the process must be brought up out of band, and the hook is
the confirmed, stable way to do it.

*Considered and rejected: plugin **monitors*** (`monitors/monitors.json`), which Claude
Code does start at session start and on reload. Three disqualifiers, all confirmed: every
line a monitor writes to stdout is delivered to Claude as a **notification**, so a server
would spam the conversation; monitors explicitly **cannot reference `${user_config.*}`**,
which is where the port and any token live; and they carry **no documented crash-restart**,
are marked experimental with a schema that may change, and need a full session restart
rather than `/reload-plugins` to pick up changes. LSP servers are the only component with
a real supervision contract (`restartOnCrash`, `maxRestarts`, `shutdownTimeout`) — worth
remembering if host-owned supervision ever becomes worth the abuse of declaring a
non-LSP process as one.

Regardless of transport, the server must **never log to stdout** — file only. That is a
hard constraint under monitors and merely good hygiene otherwise.

`engram_start`, `engram_stop`, and `engram_status` are also exposed as MCP tools so the
agent can manage the server mid-session. They cannot bootstrap a cold start — if the
server is down, its own tools are unreachable — so their descriptions must say what they
are for (restart, deliberate stop, health) rather than implying they can revive it.

**The adoption denominator changes.** One `server-start` record per session was only ever
valid because stdio gave one process per session. A daemon starts once, so that count
collapses to 1 and the probe would silently under-report. It is replaced by a
`session-open` record emitted whenever the server mints a new `Mcp-Session-Id` — exactly
one per Claude Code session, and a real identity rather than a proxy.

**Verified, with one dependency worth stating plainly (2026-08-04).** A throwaway AOT
spike confirmed `ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore` 2.0.0 on
`WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder` publishes with **zero trim warnings**, produces a
16.6 MB native binary linking only system frameworks, and serves a full
`initialize` → `tools/list` → `tools/call` handshake from the published binary.

But `HttpServerTransportOptions.Stateless` **defaults to `true`** as of the 2026-07-28
protocol revision, and in stateless mode the server mints **no session identity at all** —
the first spike run produced no `Mcp-Session-Id` on any response. Everything above that
depends on that header requires `WithHttpTransport(o => o.Stateless = false)` set
deliberately.

That is a real dependency, not a formality. The SDK describes stateful mode as *"a
back-compat-only escape hatch for legacy clients"* (SEP-2567), so this design rests on a
mode the ecosystem is moving away from. In stateless mode nothing distinguishes one Claude
Code session from another at the transport layer, because Claude Code does not send its own
session id to MCP servers (§D12 research). Worth revisiting whenever the SDK version moves.

**Noted, not built: the primer could carry the session id instead.** The `SessionStart`
hook already receives Claude Code's real `session_id` on stdin. The primer could name it,
and the agent could pass it back on `remember` and `recall` — no transport involvement, so
it survives a stateless-only future.

It is also, on its face, the better design. Today's two id-spaces do not join: hooks record
under Claude Code's `session_id`, the server under its own. That split is why compaction
survival is a timestamp heuristic, why the probe carries two separate session counts, and
why the session-memory primer line had to be deleted as structurally dead. `Mcp-Session-Id`
does not close it — it is a *third* id. A primer-carried id would be the same one the hooks
use, making all three of those exact rather than approximate, and it extends to subagents
through the `SubagentStart` primer.

Its cost is the reason it is not being built yet: it depends on the model actually passing
a parameter, and D12's whole finding is that every demand made of the model is somewhere
adoption leaks. It would have to be optional, validated against session ids the hooks have
registered, falling back to `Mcp-Session-Id` when absent or unrecognised. Whether the model
reliably passes parameters is something M0's telemetry can answer, so this waits for
evidence rather than being adopted on the strength of the argument.

#### How the plugin reaches the daemon, and what is still unverified

`plugin/.mcp.json` is an `http` entry pointing at `http://127.0.0.1:7433/`. Nothing in that
file can start a server, so `SessionStart` runs `hooks/ensure-server.sh` ahead of the primer
hook. That script exists rather than a bare command for two reasons, both of which would be
silent faults: on `SessionStart` anything a hook prints to stdout is injected into the
model's context as `additionalContext`, so `engram started (pid 1234, port 7433)` would
become a line of every session's prompt; and a memory server that fails to start makes a
degraded session, not a broken one, so the script always exits 0.

The cost is measured, not assumed: **cold start 132 ms, warm start 16 ms, status 15 ms.**
Since the daemon outlives the session that started it, only the first session after a reboot
pays the cold number, and 132 ms is far inside any hook budget. This was the one number that
could have sunk the design — a hook that has to wait on a server is a hook that can time
out — and it does not.

Two things are built from documentation and remain unconfirmed against a running Claude
Code. Both fail closed:

- **Ordering.** Whether the MCP client connects before `SessionStart` hooks finish. If it
  does, the first session after a reboot loses its memory tools; every later session finds
  the daemon already up. Worst case is one degraded session, not a broken install.
- **`Origin`.** The server rejects any request carrying an `Origin` header, which is the
  standard DNS-rebinding defence for a localhost server. `Origin` is a browser concept and
  Node's `fetch` does not add one, so this should never fire — but if Claude Code does send
  it, every call returns 403. Verifiable in one session with `claude --plugin-dir`.

Cold start is structurally out of reach of the `engram_start` MCP tool: a tool call cannot
arrive when there is no server to receive it. That tool therefore reports and repairs a
missing or disagreeing pid file rather than starting anything, and starting the daemon stays
the hook's job. `engram_stop` schedules its shutdown ~500 ms out so the reply survives the
connection it travels on.

### Reading the M0 numbers honestly

Two documented behaviours distort the adoption metric, and both must be known before
anyone concludes anything from it.

**A crashed server is invisible.** Claude Code does not automatically reconnect stdio
MCP servers. `server-start` has already been recorded by the time a crash happens, so a
session whose server died halfway looks exactly like a session where the agent stopped
bothering. Low adoption is therefore not evidence of disinterest until a crash has been
ruled out — and optimizing primer wording for a process that was not running is a very
easy way to waste a fortnight.

**Web sessions may start servers lazily.** The eager-start guarantee that makes
`server-start` a valid denominator is documented for interactive local sessions. A web
session can start a plugin server on demand after an idle wake, which would under-count.
The probe reports MCP and hook session counts separately partly for this reason.

### D15 — Durable guidance belongs in tool descriptions; only volatile guidance in the primer

Prompted by `claude-mem`, which exposes an always-visible `important_workflow` tool
carrying its retrieval protocol as prose. The mechanism does not transfer, but the
observation behind it does.

**Why the mechanism does not transfer.** `claude-mem` needs that tool because its
retrieval is a three-call protocol — `search` returns a stub index (~50–100 tokens per
result), then `timeline`, then `get_observations` for the bodies. `important_workflow`
exists to teach a *sequence*, and the sequence exists because their `search` is
deliberately not self-sufficient. `engram_recall` answers in one call. There is no
intermediate state to disclose, so a fifth always-visible tool would spend permanent
definition budget describing a workflow one step long.

**What does transfer.** Tool descriptions persist for the whole session; primer text
injected at `SessionStart` is ordinary context and is summarized away by compaction.
Today `PrimerBuilder` puts both kinds of guidance in the volatile channel.

Decision: **split the primer by lifetime.** Guidance that is true in every session —
memory is cheap, prefer recall before exploring, flush with `engram_digest` — moves into
the existing `engram_recall` and `engram_remember` descriptions, which already run 403
and 715 characters and cost their tokens whether or not they carry it. Guidance that is
true only of *this* session — the live fact count and the topic-coverage line — stays in
the hook, because it cannot be a static string.

Cost accepted: tool descriptions become prompt-engineering surface and need the same
golden-file treatment D9 gives the recall output contract. A description edit is an
interface change, not a comment.

### D16 — A timeline view over session provenance, gated on a density check

The supersession chain is **truth-history**: what a belief became. It cannot answer
**time-history**: what else was being learned when this was learned. Facts recorded in
one session are often causally related in ways no predicate captures, and that
co-occurrence is already stored as session provenance.

Decision: expose it as a *view* on the existing expand path — an anchor fact plus its
session neighbours before and after — not as a new top-level tool. This is a query over
data already written; it requires no schema change, and it does not widen the tool
surface D17 budgets.

**Gated, not scheduled.** `claude-mem` anchors its timeline on *observations* — tool-use
events, which are dense and naturally chronological. Engram stores *facts*, which are far
sparser: a session may produce three. A neighbour window over three facts is not context,
it is noise. Before this is built, measure the real distribution of facts-per-session on
the author's own instance. If the median session yields fewer than roughly five facts,
the view does not earn its tokens and this decision lapses.

**Measured, and lapsed.** The author's instance, replayed into a scratch home so the real
one was not touched: **7 sessions had written a fact, 34 facts between them, distribution
`[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 8, 20]` — median 1 against a gate of 5.** Not marginal, and the mean
(4.9) misses too. Seventeen sessions had run in total, so across *all* sessions the median
is 0; the reported figure is already the generous one, because a session row exists only
once that session has written.

The shape is the interesting part, and it is not "sessions are uniformly thin" — it is
bimodal. One design-heavy session produced 20 facts and would make a fine timeline; five of
the seven produced one or two and would produce a window containing only the anchor. A
median gate is the right test for exactly this: the view's value is concentrated in rare
sessions, and building it would mean paying tokens on the tool surface (D17) in every
session to serve the few.

What would reopen this is density, not time — if a later milestone makes facts routine
rather than deliberate (digest actually persisting, or a capture path wider than
first-person statements), re-run the measurement before assuming the answer still holds.
`engram probe` reports the distribution now, so re-running it is one command rather than a
study.

**The first of those triggers has fired: `engram_digest` now persists.** One call can add up
to 25 notes, against a measured median of 1 fact per fact-writing session — so a single
digest in a session moves that session past the gate on its own. This does not reopen D16
yet, because nothing has been measured: the gate is about what sessions *typically* produce,
and no session has yet run against a persisting digest. Re-run `engram probe` after real use
before concluding either way. What would be wrong is to leave the lapse recorded as settled
when the thing that justified it has changed.

### D17 — The tool surface is a per-session token cost with a stated ceiling

Measured 2026-08-05: the four memory tools in `EngramMcpTools.cs` cost **2,575 characters
of definitions** (`recall` 521, `remember` 1,142, `forget` 403, `digest` 509 — description
plus schema), roughly 640 tokens, paid on every session whether or not memory is used.
Three more tools ship alongside them (`start`, `status`, `stop`).

That figure was 2,399 when this decision was written, and the drift is the ceiling doing its
job: `forget` grew when it learned to retract session notes, `digest` when it started
persisting them. Both were paid for deliberately — the second is 25 characters under the
ceiling, and buying it meant cutting words from the same description rather than raising the
limit. There are 25 characters left, so the next tool that wants more has to take it from
one that has it.

`claude-mem` cut 9 overlapping tools (~2,500 tokens) to 4. We are already at 4 memory
tools and they do not overlap, so there is no consolidation to do — but the cost was
never an explicit line item, which is how a surface grows to 9 without anyone deciding to.

Decision: **tool-definition token cost is tracked, with a test.** A tier-1 test asserts
the total serialized `tools/list` payload stays under a stated ceiling; raising the
ceiling is a deliberate edit with a rationale, the same treatment D9 gives hook latency.
Any new tool must argue its cost against the alternative of a parameter on an existing
one — which is why D16 is a view on expand rather than a `timeline` tool.

> **Supersedes an earlier reading.** An analysis in session prep claimed ten tools and
> proposed cutting `engram_start` as unreachable. The count was wrong, and D14 has already

> *because* a tool call cannot arrive with no server to receive it, so it reports and
> repairs a disagreeing pid file instead of starting anything. It is not dead weight; it
> is a different tool than its name suggests.

### D18 — Semantic retrieval is a local `sqlite-vec` lane, never a vector service

M4 already names `IEmbedder`, a `sqlite-vec` lane, and RRF fusion. This records *what it
buys and what it must not become*, because "add a vector database" is the version of this
that quietly costs a second daemon.

**What semantic search buys: vocabulary mismatch.** FTS5 matches tokens. It cannot connect
a query to a fact that records the same thing in different words — *"what's my kid's
name"* against a stored *"son is Liam"*, or *"how do we avoid database lock errors"*
against *"every write is `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`"*. This is the dominant failure mode for a
memory system specifically, because the user writing the query and the agent that wrote
the fact chose their words in different sessions, months apart, with no shared vocabulary.
A missed recall here is invisible — the agent simply explores files instead, and the
telemetry in D12 records it as disinterest.

**What FTS5 keeps winning, which is why this is a lane and not a replacement.** Embeddings
blur rare tokens, and this domain is full of them: `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT`, `EngramHome`,
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, RIDs, file paths, error codes. Exact-identifier recall is where lexical
search is not merely adequate but strictly better. Fusing the two ranks by **RRF**
(`Σ 1/(k + rank)`, k≈60) rather than by blended scores, because BM25 rank and cosine
distance are not on comparable scales and any normalization between them is a tuning knob
nobody will ever have evidence to set.

**Why not ChromaDB.** It is a separate Python service. Adopting it would mean a second
supervised process, a Python runtime in the dependency chain, and a network hop — against
a design whose core is a single Native AOT binary (D1) that already holds the SQLite file
open. `sqlite-vec` is a loadable extension over that same file: one process, one database,
one backup, and query plans stay visible per the no-ORM rule. Embedding *generation* rides
the llama.cpp that D1 already side-loads into `~/.engram/lib/`, behind
`engram init --with-embeddings`.

**Model: `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`, GGUF quantized, 1024 dimensions.** This is not chosen
from a benchmark table — it is running prior art. A separate project of the author's already
executes exactly this stack in production: Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B in-process through
**LLamaSharp**, no external API and no Ollama hop, feeding a **`sqlite-vec`** store. It
replaced `nomic-embed-text` there specifically because nomic underperformed on **mixed
code-and-prose content**.

That rationale transfers with unusual force. Most systems embed one kind of text; Engram
embeds prose beliefs *and*, once D24 lands, code facts extracted from C# and TypeScript —
into the same store, retrieved by the same query. Mixed code-and-prose is not an edge case
here, it is the corpus. An evaluation someone already paid for, on the exact content shape,
beats a fresh comparison of general-purpose sentence encoders.

Three consequences of the larger model, all absorbed by decisions already made:

- **Storage**: 1024 dims at float32 is ~4 KB per fact, so ten thousand facts cost ~40 MB.
  Irrelevant at this scale. Int8 quantization to ~1 KB is available and not needed yet.
- **Download**: a quantized 0.6B model is a few hundred megabytes, against ~90 MB for a
  small sentence encoder. Acceptable *only* because it sits behind
  `engram init --with-embeddings` and because FTS5-only remains a fully supported
  configuration rather than a degraded one — a promise this makes load-bearing.
- **Latency**: 0.6B parameters cost meaningfully more per embedding than a 22M encoder.
  Also absorbed: embedding already runs server-side and off the write path, so this is
  throughput on a background queue, not latency on a hook.

**Providers: LLamaSharp in-process by default, LM Studio or Ollama as alternatives.** The
same prior-art system supports all three behind one seam, which is what M4's `IEmbedder`
already anticipated. Engram takes the same shape, for two reasons beyond parity.

First, it is free capacity. A user already running Ollama or LM Studio has the model weights
and the runtime; pointing at them avoids a second several-hundred-megabyte download for no
gain. Second — and this is the part that changes the risk profile — **an HTTP provider is
trivially AOT-safe**. If LLamaSharp proves hostile to Native AOT, the vector lane does not
die with it; it ships with the in-process provider unavailable and the local-server
providers working. That converts the riskiest item in M4 from a blocker into a degraded
mode.

This does not reopen D20. Ollama and LM Studio are reached over **localhost**, so nothing
leaves the machine and the local-only guarantee holds — the objection to ChromaDB was never
that it spoke a protocol, it was that it was a *required* second daemon dragging a Python
runtime behind it. D20's line governs here unchanged: Engram must be complete with none of
them installed, which is what the in-process default and the FTS5-only fallback are for.

**The invariant that makes providers safe, and the quiet way this breaks.** Vectors from
different models are not comparable. Cosine distance between a Qwen3 embedding and a
`nomic-embed-text` embedding is a real number, it is meaningless, and nothing about it looks
wrong — retrieval simply degrades into confident nonsense. Dimensions differ too (1024 here,
768 for nomic, 384 for the small encoders), so a provider change can invalidate the
`sqlite-vec` table itself rather than merely its contents.

Therefore the vector index records **which model and which dimension produced it**, as index
metadata rather than per row. A provider or model change is detected, not assumed away:
`doctor` reports the mismatch, and `embed --rebuild` is the remedy. This sits cleanly inside
existing rules — the index is derived state, so D8 permits `repair` to rebuild it, and D23's
`regenerable` marker already distinguishes what may be discarded. `engram explain` (D21)
reports the model that produced each vector, because "which embedding space is this" is
exactly the sort of question an unexplainable ranking hides.

**Embeddings are derived state, and that settles three things at once.** Under D8 they are
repairable, so `repair` may rebuild the vector index and `embed --rebuild` is not a special
case. Under D4 hooks still never open the database, so embedding happens in the server,
off the write path, asynchronously. And a fact written but not yet embedded is still found
by FTS5 — the lane degrades to lexical-only rather than to a missing result, which means
backfill latency is never a correctness bug.

Cost accepted: recall output becomes model-dependent, so tier-2 tests need a deterministic
stub `IEmbedder` and must assert set membership rather than exact ordering. An install
without `--with-embeddings` runs FTS5-only and must stay a supported configuration, not a
degraded one — which also keeps the default install free of a model download.

D5 (contradiction detection, cut from v1) is reconsidered here and not before: detecting
that two facts contradict requires knowing they are *about the same thing* in different
words, which is the same capability, and attempting it lexically is why it was cut.

### D19 — Facts carry a provenance tier, and it is authored, not derived

Imported from Graphify, which tags every edge `EXTRACTED` (read from an AST) or `INFERRED`
(resolved by heuristic or model) so a consumer can tell what is grounded from what is
guessed. Engram has the raw material for this distinction and does not expose it.

The problem is concrete. Recall output is read by a model, and that model currently cannot
tell *"Jim said this, in these words"* from *"an agent concluded this from a diff."* Those
warrant different trust and sometimes different action — one is a premise, the other is a
hypothesis worth re-checking. Collapsing them is a silent correctness hazard in exactly the
situations where memory matters most.

**Three tiers, ordinal, no confidence score.**

| Tier | Means | Re-checkable? |
|---|---|---|
| `stated` | The user asserted it. Authored by the human. | No — it is testimony, not observation |
| `observed` | Derived from an artifact that existed: a file, command output, a diff, an API response. Carries `evidence`. | Yes, against the artifact |
| `inferred` | An agent's conclusion. No artifact backs it directly. | No, but it can be re-argued |

A user statement rewritten by an agent for self-containment stays `stated`. The content is
still the user's claim; the supersession row already records that a rewrite happened, so a
fourth tier would encode something the history already carries.

**No numeric confidence.** Graphify attaches a score; we deliberately do not. A float is a
tuning knob, and nobody will ever have the evidence to set it — the same argument D18 uses
to reject score-blending in favour of RRF. An ordinal tier is enough to break a tie, and it
cannot be fiddled with.

**Provenance is belief content, so it is immutable and unrepairable.** It is written at
insert and never updated, alongside predicate, body, and validity. This has a consequence
worth stating plainly because it is exactly the kind of thing a later contributor will try
to be helpful about: **`repair` may never assign or correct a provenance tier.** Where a
fact came from cannot be re-derived from the fact itself, so under D8's derived/authored
line it sits firmly on the authored side. A `repair` that "fixes missing provenance" is
inventing testimony.

**No migration, because this landed before the store did.** The first draft specified a
nullable column meaning *unknown, predates the tier*, with no backfill by guessing. That is
now moot and the simpler thing is true instead: no database exists yet, so `learned_via` is
`NOT NULL` with a `CHECK` constraint from the first `CREATE TABLE`. There is no era of facts
without provenance and never will be. Folding this into `docs/engram-schema.sql` before M1
rather than after was worth more than the decision itself.

Two things in the authored schema had to be reconciled, both settled there:

- **`learned_via` already existed** with the values `stated | observed | derived | indexed`.
  Three of those are provenance and one is not — `indexed` describes where a row came from,
  which is regenerability, and is precisely the conflation D23 exists to prevent. It was
  already latent in the schema. `indexed` is gone; code facts are `observed` provenance with
  `regenerable = 1`. `derived` is renamed to `inferred`, because "derived" already means
  *regenerable* in D8's vocabulary and using it for a provenance tier in the same codebase
  invites exactly the mistake.
- **`confidence REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.8` is removed.** It is the numeric score this
  decision rejects, and its own default was the argument: a value nobody had evidence to
  set, applied uniformly to every fact, tuned by no one. Deleting it cost nothing because no
  row had ever been written.

**Surfaced, not scored.** The tier appears in recall output as a compact marker — one or two
tokens per fact, budgeted under D17 — and retrieval ranking does **not** consult it. Letting
provenance tilt salience would be a second tuning knob doing the first one's job. The model
sees the tier and decides; the ranker stays about relevance.

This gives D5 the thing it was missing. Contradiction detection was cut partly because two
conflicting facts offered no principled basis for choosing between them. `stated` over
`observed` over `inferred` is such a basis, and it does not require resolving the semantics
of the conflict — which is the expensive part. D5 is reconsidered alongside D18's vector
evidence, now with a tiebreak in hand.

### D20 — The code graph is built in-house; Graphify stays optional and unrequired

Two positions were considered. The first draft of this decision said *recommend and
coexist* — do not vendor Graphify, but point users at it, on the grounds that consuming an
MCP server is not really a dependency. **That reasoning was wrong and is corrected here.**

**An MCP server is a dependency with a protocol boundary in front of it.** If Engram's
documentation steers users to Graphify for code questions, and users come to rely on that,
Engram has taken on a Python service, an LLM egress path, and a pre-1.0 release cadence —
it has merely moved them where they do not show up in `pyproject.toml` or a `.csproj`.
Abstraction changes who notices the coupling, not whether it exists. Worse, a runtime
coupling is harder to audit than a declared one: nothing in the repository records it.

The concrete objections stand and are strengthened, not weakened, by being at arm's length.
Graphify is a **Python 3.10+ runtime** against a packaging thesis of one Native AOT binary
with no runtime (D1). Its `graph.json` is held in memory under a 512 MB cap, which does not
compose with a SQLite/WAL store several processes open at once (D4). It **sends documents,
PDFs, and images to a configured LLM**, which would puncture Engram's local-only guarantee
at a layer users could not see — and a guarantee broken by a *recommended companion tool* is
broken just the same. It is pre-1.0 at v0.9.33 with 201 releases in four months, 803 open
issues, and 70% of commits from a single author. And having no temporal model, its output
could not enter the fact store without a translation layer costing about what M3 costs.

Decision: **M3 is built in-house when its gate opens.** Engram never requires, invokes, or
assumes Graphify. The line that makes "optional" mean something:

> No Engram capability may work only when Graphify is installed. Engram is complete
> without it, or the feature does not ship.

Cost accepted, explicitly: M3 duplicates work that is freely available and four months
ahead. That is paid on purpose. A memory system that quietly needs a Python service to
answer code questions is not the single-binary local tool D1 promises, and the promise is
the product. Independence here is not pride; it is the thing being sold.

What "optional" reduces to in practice: a user who installs Graphify alongside Engram gets
both MCP servers, and the agent calls each directly. Engram neither knows nor cares. Facts
learned that way arrive through `engram_remember` at the `observed` or `inferred` tier per
D19 — the ordinary write path, coupling nothing, and identical to a fact learned from `grep`.

### D21 — Retrieval must be explainable, and the explainer ships with the vector lane

Graphify's stated principle is *"every edge explained"*, backed by a `graphify explain`
command. The principle transfers even though the implementation does not, and it lands on a
real and worsening gap.

Recall is already opaque. FTS5 rank and salience combine to produce an ordering nobody can
account for after the fact, and **D18 makes this materially worse**: RRF fuses two
independently ranked lists, so the reason a fact placed third becomes a function of its
position in two rankings that are themselves never shown. Adding a semantic lane without an
explainer means shipping a retrieval system whose failures cannot be diagnosed, only
re-rolled.

This bites hardest exactly where the project has staked its health metric. D12 and §12 make
**recall coverage** the measure of whether Engram works, which makes *missed recalls* the
unit of debugging — and a missed recall that cannot be explained cannot be fixed. Without
this, the response to "why didn't it find that?" is guesswork about primer wording, which
§"Reading the M0 numbers honestly" already identifies as a very easy way to waste a
fortnight.

Decision: `engram explain <query>` reports, per candidate fact — lexical rank and BM25
score, vector rank and cosine distance, salience contribution, the fused RRF position, and
the D19 provenance tier. Read-only, no side effects.

**Sequencing is the load-bearing part of this decision: the explainer ships with or before
the vector lane, never after.** A debugging tool added once the thing it debugs is already
in production is a tool built against remembered intentions rather than observed behaviour.
Concretely, this moves ahead of §6.1's step 8 (RRF fusion) and is a prerequisite for it.

This is also just the existing house rule one layer up. "No ORM. Hand-written SQL, so query
plans stay visible" is a commitment to legibility at the storage layer; D21 extends it to
the ranking layer, where the opacity is now greater and the consequences are quieter.

### D22 — The user can read everything stored about them, in one artifact

Graphify emits `GRAPH_REPORT.md` and `graph.html` beside its machine-readable graph. The
underlying gap is real here and sharper than it is for a code tool, because Engram's
contents are personal and were written **while the user was not watching**. Passive capture
is the entire point of the design — it is also what makes this obligation rather than
polish.

Nothing today enumerates. `doctor` reports health, not content. `recall` answers a question,
which means it shows what matched a query and is structurally incapable of showing what the
user never thought to ask about. So the current answer to *"what do you actually know about
me?"* is: run queries until you stop being surprised.

That interacts badly with `forget`. D7 and the local-only posture cover **confidentiality** —
data does not leave the machine. They say nothing about the user's **own access**, and
retraction without enumeration is not a real control: you cannot forget what you cannot find,
and a user who half-remembers an offhand remark has no way to check whether it was kept.

Decision: `engram report` — read-only, generates a Markdown artifact of everything stored.
Per fact: body, subject and predicate, validity window, D19 provenance tier, evidence, and
the identifier `forget` takes. Grouped by subject, and **including closed and superseded
facts, marked as such** — the history is the product, and it is also the part most worth
auditing, since a retracted belief that lingers in a chain is exactly what a user would want
to find.

Two constraints that are the decision rather than details:

- **No truncation, ever.** No top-N, no salience filter, no eliding the long tail. Every
  other output in this system is budgeted against a token ceiling; this one is not, because
  a report that silently omits is worse than no report at all when the purpose is audit. If
  it is long, it is long.
- **Markdown, not HTML.** No browser, no asset pipeline, no bundled viewer. It renders in a
  terminal, an editor, and a diff, and it survives being pasted into an issue. Graphify's
  `graph.html` suits a graph nobody can read as text; a fact store is already prose, and a
  visualization would be a second thing to maintain in service of no additional
  understanding.

Generated on demand and never stored, so it sits outside D8's derived/authored question
entirely — there is nothing for `repair` or `compact` to reconcile.

Ordering: this belongs with D19 rather than after it. Provenance is most of what makes the
report worth reading, and a report is the fastest way to find out whether the tiers were
assigned sensibly in the first place.

### D23 — `regenerable` is a separate axis from provenance, and `repair` keys off it alone

The code graph shares one database with the belief store — the sidecar returns
entities/edges/facts over stdio and the core writes them (D1), into the same file that
holds everything else. That sharing is the point: a standalone code graph answers *what
calls this function*, while code entities living beside beliefs answer *what did we decide
about this function, and what superseded it*. No snapshot tool can do the second.

It also creates a trap. D19's provenance tier and D8's derived/authored line look like the
same distinction and are not:

| | Regenerable? | Provenance (D19) |
|---|---|---|
| Code fact from an AST | **Yes** — recompute from the file | `observed` |
| Agent fact from command output | **No** — the output is gone | `observed` |
| Fact from a user statement | No | `stated` |

Two rows share a provenance tier and sit on opposite sides of D8. So an implementation of
`repair` that reads "rebuild the derived facts" as *"drop the `observed` ones and re-index"*
— an entirely reasonable reading — silently destroys every agent observation that can never
be recovered. That is precisely the failure the derived/authored rule exists to prevent, and
D19 as written makes it easier to reach, not harder.

Decision: facts carry a **`regenerable`** marker, set at insert, immutable, and wholly
independent of the provenance tier. It asserts one thing — *this fact can be recomputed from
an artifact that still exists* — and only the code indexer sets it. **`repair` and `compact`
key off `regenerable` and must never consult provenance.** Provenance describes how much to
trust a fact; `regenerable` describes whether destroying it loses anything. Ranking uses
neither.

Deletion of a source file does not retroactively clear the marker. The fact is not
destroyed and not rewritten — it is flagged stale by M3's existing stale-subject mechanism,
which is the same treatment D2 gives a moved entity. Append-only survives intact.

The guard, per the house rule that an unfalsifiable test is worthless: assert that `repair`
removes regenerable facts and leaves everything else, then **prove it by flipping one agent
observation to `regenerable` and confirming `repair` would consume it**. A test that passes
because nothing was ever at risk has demonstrated nothing.

### D24 — Three analyzer tiers, one language registry, C# then TypeScript/JavaScript

Priority is set by what actually gets worked on: **C# first, TypeScript/JavaScript second,
everything else behind a registry row.** That is a delivery order. The architecture below is
what keeps it from becoming a ceiling.

**Three tiers, distinguished by what they cost, not by what they parse.**

| Tier | Mechanism | Cost | Gets us |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 · Universal** | Managed, in-core, no dependencies | None | Works on any file, including ones we have never heard of |
| **1 · Syntactic** | `tree-sitter` via `NativeLibrary.Load` from `~/.engram/lib/`, one grammar per language | One native lib, one grammar file per language | Definitions, references, imports/exports, structure |
| **2 · Semantic** | A language's own toolchain, in a sidecar that never opens the database | A whole extra binary and its ecosystem | Real type and overload resolution |

Tier 1 is the one that makes languages cheap. `tree-sitter` is a C library loaded the same
way `sqlite-vec` and llama.cpp already are under D1, so a new language costs a grammar and a
registry row — not a runtime, not a sidecar, not a dependency in the shipped artifact.

**Tier 2 is reserved, and TypeScript does not get it.** C# gets Roslyn because D1 already
commits to that sidecar and it is the language this project is written in. TypeScript's
equivalent depth would mean the TypeScript compiler API, which means **a Node runtime** —
and D20 has just finished rejecting exactly that shape of coupling for Python. The same
argument binds here or it was never an argument. TS/JS therefore ship at tier 1, and if
telemetry later shows syntactic extraction genuinely insufficient, that is a decision taken
then, on evidence, with the Node question faced honestly rather than smuggled in.

**One registry, and adding a language edits nothing else.** A single table declares, per
language: id, file extensions, grammar, tier, and which extractors apply. Adding a language
is one row plus a grammar file, with **zero edits to the indexer, the CLI, the report, or
the test harness**. If adding a language requires touching a `switch`, the abstraction has
not landed and the row is decoration.

Two constraints that make this real rather than aspirational:

- **The registry is a static table, not discovery.** Native AOT cannot scan assemblies for
  implementations, so registration is explicit and compile-time. This is a constraint worth
  welcoming: it keeps the enumerable kind enumerable and greppable.
- **The conformance suite iterates the registry.** One fixture-driven set of assertions runs
  for every entry — extraction produces entities, entities resolve, re-indexing an unchanged
  file is a no-op, a renamed symbol keeps its `entity.id` per D2. A harness carrying its own
  copy of the language list is the exact failure this decision exists to prevent, and a lint
  test should say so.

Every fact these analyzers write is `observed` (D19) and `regenerable` (D23), without
exception. That is what makes a full re-index safe.

### D25 — Native AOT is a per-process requirement, not a project-wide one

Raised while weighing what to do if LLamaSharp proves AOT-hostile: AOT is a means, and if
it costs us the embedding stack we should ask what it was actually buying and whether that
can be bought another way. Taking the question seriously produces a better answer than
either "keep AOT and drop LLamaSharp" or "drop AOT".

**What AOT gives, and what survives without it.**

| What it buys | Replaceable? |
|---|---|
| Single file, no runtime installed | **Yes** — self-contained deployment gets there. Costs artifact size, not correctness |
| Steady-state throughput | **Not a reason to keep it.** After warmup, tiered JIT is frequently *faster* than AOT |
| Memory footprint | **Mostly** — matters least, since the daemon is long-lived |
| **Cold start** | **No.** ReadyToRun narrows the gap; it does not close it |

Only the last one is load-bearing, and only in one place. The MCP server is a supervised
long-lived daemon (D14), so it pays startup once per launch and JIT warmup is amortized into
nothing. Recall runs inside that daemon. Neither cares much.

**The hook does.** `engram hook file-touched` is a fresh process on every file touch, and
its budget must hold unconditionally rather than only when nothing else is writing (D4).
§1.5 measured the gap directly: **3.44 ms median for the AOT build against 18.51 ms
self-contained without it.** The non-AOT build spends most of a budget's worth of time
before doing any work, and no configuration recovers that, because the cost is process
start itself. That single path is why AOT stays.

> **The 10 ms target is asserted, not derived.** It enters at `docs/engram-spec.md:532` as
> one entry in a list of performance targets, with no measurement, citation, or reasoning
> attached, and everything downstream — D4, this decision, `HookCommand.cs` — inherits it

So the boundary is not *this project is AOT*. It is **the latency-critical process is AOT,
and everything else may be whatever it needs to be.** D1 already drew exactly this line for
Roslyn: MSBuild and MEF are hostile to trimming, so they went in a sidecar and the core
never links them. LLamaSharp takes the same escape hatch on the same reasoning, and needs no
new architecture to do it.

One difference from the Roslyn sidecar matters. Roslyn is spawned per batch and a ~300 ms
start amortizes fine. An embedder cannot work that way — loading several hundred megabytes
of weights per batch would dominate everything. The embedder sidecar is therefore
**long-lived**, a supervised child of the D14 daemon, started on demand and kept warm.

**The practical consequence: M4 does not have to answer the AOT question to ship.** The
order of attack is now a ladder, cheapest and least risky first:

1. **Localhost providers** (Ollama, LM Studio) — no AOT exposure, no process to supervise,
   and per D18 already a supported configuration.
2. **In-process LLamaSharp** — if it turns out AOT-clean, this becomes the default and the
   ladder stops here. **Measured 2026-08-05: it is, and it does.** Spike E in §1.5.
3. **An owned embedder sidecar** — only if LLamaSharp is AOT-hostile *and* we want embedding
   that does not require the user to install someone else's runtime.

Step 3 exists because D20's rule binds here too: an opt-in feature that works only when a
third-party tool is installed is weaker than one whose dependency we ship. It is third on
the ladder because it is the most work, not because it is optional forever.

**Step 3 is now unnecessary, and step 1 is what remains optional.** Spike E puts the
in-process provider in the AOT binary, which is what step 3 existed to recover if it could
not go there. The localhost providers stay — they are free capacity for a user already
running Ollama or LM Studio, per D18 — but they are no longer load-bearing, so nothing about
M4 waits on them. One correction to the reasoning above rather than the conclusion: the
sidecar was framed as the fallback for AOT-hostility, and the thing that would actually have
forced it is not hostility but the 6.5 s model load, which makes any per-batch process a
non-starter. In-process inherits that constraint rather than escaping it — the weights load
once into the long-lived daemon and unload on idle, which is what `idle_unload_minutes`
already describes.

This demotes the AOT spike from gating to informative: it decides *which rung* M4 lands on,
not whether M4 happens. And it stays falsifiable — if the 10 ms hook budget is ever shown
achievable without AOT, on measurement rather than argument, this decision should be
reopened, because at that point AOT would be buying only artifact size.

### D26 — User captures are ordinary facts, and forgetting is not scoped by origin

Captured user statements shipped in their own JSON directory, with their own `ReadActive`
walking `retracts` and `supersedes` links to work out what still stood. That was a **second
implementation of the validity window** the `fact` table already had, and the two agreed
only by coincidence. It also got none of `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, `busy_timeout`, or a
supersession row saying *why* a belief changed. Same data, one temporal model.

**The statement is its own subject.** A capture lands at
`/user/{about-you,instructions}/<fingerprint>`, where the fingerprint is eight hex
characters of SHA-256 over the statement with case, punctuation, and whitespace runs
normalized away. That is what makes `ux_fact_live` do the right thing here: a per-statement
subject means each capture supersedes only itself, where a shared subject like
`/user/about-you` would have made every new statement close the previous one.

Two behaviours fall out of the addressing rather than being coded as policy:

- **Saying something twice captures it once.** The JSON store could not tell a repeat from
  a new statement — it had no key to compare on — so every restatement became another row
  in recall.
- **A repeat does not undo a rewrite.** The already-present check is on the *entity*, not
  the body: after the model rewrites a capture into something self-contained, the user
  typing the original again must not drag it back. What the store already knows wins.

Retracted is the asymmetric case, and deliberately so: a retracted statement has no live
fact, so saying it again captures it afresh. That is the opposite of the seed corpus, which
stays silent about anything this store has held before. A re-seed is nobody asking for a
fact back; a user typing the sentence again is.

**`engram_forget` closes any live fact, including seeded ones.** Not scope creep — the
consequence of the unification. Once user captures are ordinary facts there is no honest
way to keep the old restriction, and inventing a marker to preserve it would rebuild the
split this removed. It is also the right answer on its own: refusing to close a fact
because of where it came from is the store telling a user which of their own memories they
may drop. The seeder's refusal to rewrite any subject+predicate the store has held before
is what makes a retraction survive a corpus revision, so this composes rather than leaking.

The cost is a handle change — `u1a2b3c4d` becomes `f42` — which the golden file surfaced as
an intended diff rather than a silent one.

**The replay that carried this across has since been deleted.** `init` used to import the
pre-database JSON captures and session JSONL in timestamp order, rewrites landing at the
address of the capture they replaced so the supersession chain survived the move. It existed
for exactly one installation — the author's — and Engram has not shipped, so no other store
can contain those files. Carrying ~350 lines of import into a first public release would
mean every new user's first command runs a migration for files that cannot exist, and the
`user-facts/` directory it read is gone with it. If a pre-release store still holds the only
copy of something, the supported move is to read it out before upgrading, not to make the
released binary carry the reader forever.

---

### D27 — A codebase is addressed inside its project, not beside it

`/code/<repo>/…` and `/projects/<name>/…` were siblings at the root, which gets the
containment backwards: a project may hold several codebases, and a codebase always belongs
to one project. Code now lands at `/projects/<name>/code/<repo>/…`, a sibling of
`/projects/<name>/decisions/…`.

Containment is the weaker half of the case. The stronger half is that the query this system
runs most could not be expressed as a prefix. Recall's fusion already boosts project and
code scope *together* whenever there is repo context, and the primer wants a project's
decisions and its code in one pass — but under sibling roots that is a union of two prefixes
plus a repo→project mapping to know which two. Nested, it is one indexed range scan, which
is the operation §4.2 promises is cheap.

It also settles a question the sibling layout had no answer for: where an indexed README or
ADR goes. It is a file in a repo *and* it is prose about decisions, so under sibling roots
the choice had to be adjudicated at write time, and different callers would adjudicate it
differently. Inside a project both candidate homes are in the same subtree and the choice
stops being load-bearing.

**Siblings in the path, separate in lifecycle, and that separation is already carried
elsewhere.** Code facts are regenerable and `compact` prunes them; decisions are authored
truth it may never touch. That distinction rides on the `regenerable` column (D23), which is
its own axis precisely so it is never inferred from location — so `compact --path
/projects/<name>` still filters on the column and cannot reach a decision. Sharing a prefix
costs nothing there, and the addressing implies nothing about storage layout.

**`<repo>` stays even when a project has one codebase.** Eliding it reads better —
`/projects/engram/code/src/Engram.Core/…` — but the day a second codebase joins, every fact
under the first one changes address. `path` is mutable only to follow an entity on rename
(D2); making it also move when an unrelated sibling appears turns a bounded rule into an
open one. Predictable beats short.

**Scope stops being derivable from the root**, which the spec claimed and the code never
implemented. Code and decisions now share `/projects`, so the root cannot discriminate them.
That is a correction, not a loss: `session` scope already had no root in the §4.2 list, and
scope has been caller-supplied at every write path from the start. Scope is what kind of
knowledge a fact is and how long it lives; the path is where its subject hangs. Conflating
them was always going to break on the first root that held two kinds.

Free to land now and expensive later: nothing writes `project` scope yet, code indexing is
deferred out of M0, and the seeded corpus carries no paths at all — so this is a change to
documentation and the default `[taxonomy] roots`, with no store to migrate. After a public
release it would mean re-addressing every indexed fact in every installed store.

**Left open: how a repo learns which project it belongs to.** Nesting makes that binding a
precondition for addressing any indexed fact, and it cannot be a prompt — a first index
that stops to ask a question is a first index that does not happen. The leading candidate
is to default the project to the repo's own directory name, so a solo codebase lands at
`/projects/engram/code/engram/…` with no configuration at all, and to let a repo be re-bound
in config when a project genuinely spans several. That keeps the common case zero-effort and
makes the multi-repo case declared rather than guessed, which matters because guessing it
wrong re-addresses a subtree. Deliberately not decided here: there is no multi-codebase
project to test it against yet, and the cost of deciding it late is one default, not a
migration.

### D28 — Built from source on the machine that runs it, so packaging is not a problem we have

Engram is not a commercial product and there is no shipped binary. It is built from the
repository on the end user's machine — `install.sh` already does exactly this, via
`dotnet publish` against a detected RID. Anyone who wants to distribute it differently owns
the consequences of that.

This is worth writing down because a whole class of work disappears with it, and that class
is seductive: Developer ID signing, notarization, reproducible builds, a prebuilt platform
matrix, checksummed release artifacts, and every decision that begins "what if the build
machine differs from the user's machine." They do not differ. Time spent making them agree is
time spent on a problem this project does not have, and the honest response to the residual
risk is a README callout about building rather than machinery to eliminate it.

**Two things survive as real requirements**, and both are about what the built binary can do
rather than how it got there:

**Performance on Apple Silicon must not be silently lost.** §1.5 records the mechanism:
`ggml-metal` compiles its shaders at runtime, and the shader language version defaults to the
SDK recorded in the *main executable*, so an executable linked against an old SDK quietly runs
the pre-tensor path at roughly half speed on an M5. Under D28 this solves itself for the
artifact users get — the binary is linked by Apple's linker on the user's own machine — and
**not for the one developers run.** Measured 2026-08-06 as a controlled pair: same M5 Pro, same
MiniLM GGUF, same `libggml-metal.dylib`, differing only in which Mach-O is the main executable.
`out/engram`, stamped `sdk 26.5`, records `has tensor = true`. The `dotnet` host, prebuilt by
Microsoft and stamped `sdk 15.5`, records `false`, logging `error compiling source` on the way.
So the half-speed path is live rather than hypothetical, and it is exactly what `dotnet run` and
`dotnet test` get — a second instance of the rule tier 3 already encodes, that the JIT build
proves nothing about what ships.

**What does not follow is a build-time assertion.** Failing a build because its SDK field is
below 26 would punish someone on an M2 and macOS 14 who has no tensor cores to lose. The check
belongs at runtime, split so `doctor` stays a reader (D37): whoever loads the model records what
ggml-metal reported, and doctor reports from that record. D45's log capture keeps the
`ggml_metal` device lines — they arrive at `Info`, below the errors-and-warnings ring, and are
held in memory only, so the empty-stderr guarantee is untouched — and `LocalRuntime` writes them,
with the parsed capability and device name, to `metal.json` after a successful load. Before the
first local load doctor says "not yet observed", which is honest and costs nothing: the tensor
path has no performance to lose until something loads, so the window in which doctor is blind and
the window in which the answer does not matter are the same window.

Doctor must not infer the answer from its own binary's SDK field instead. The capability belongs
to the process that loaded, and two engram binaries legitimately serve one home (D42) — a
rebuilt-but-not-restarted server really is still running the old shaders, which the record
describes correctly and an inference would not. It would also copy ggml's gating policy, which
drifts under LLamaSharp upgrades, into a second implementation (D36).

The warning is gated on the recorded device name and not on the capability alone, because a GPU
without tensor cores reports the API disabled too — warning on that alone would red an M2 for
hardware it never had. The name is read from `ggml_metal_init: picking default device:`, never
from `GPU name:`, which answers `MTL0`: a check keyed to the obvious-looking line could never
match Apple silicon, and so could never fire. Rewriting the SDK field with `vtool` is rejected:
it makes the binary claim an SDK
it was not built against, and on an older macOS that could push the main shader compile past
what the OS supports, turning a performance problem into a broken one.

**It must build and run on Windows and Linux, with CUDA where drivers are present.** This is
the constraint that decides the provider question. An HTTP-only embedder would not need CUDA
at all — the inference server would own the GPU — so wanting CUDA is wanting llama.cpp
in-process, and D25's ladder therefore lands on rung 2 as its ordinary case rather than its
optional one. D28 makes that far cheaper than it looked: building on the target machine means
there is no five-platform binary matrix to pre-produce, because each machine resolves its own
platform at build time. What it does not make cheaper is *backend selection* — Metal on macOS,
CUDA on Linux and Windows when the driver is there, CPU otherwise — which is now a real
requirement rather than a nicety, and the loading quirks spike E measured are macOS-specific
and have no Windows or Linux equivalent yet.

CI builds all three platforms as of this decision, because under D28 "does it build here" is
the entire portability question — there is no artifact to test instead — and Linux and Windows
were previously unproven.

---

### D29 — git decides what a repository contains; content decides what is worth reading

The question is which files an indexer should read, and it has two halves that want different
answers.

**What belongs to the repository is git's call, not ours.** `git ls-files --cached --others
--exclude-standard` returns tracked files plus untracked ones that are not ignored, which
already excludes build output, dependency directories, caches and temporary files — per every
nested `.gitignore`, per `.git/info/exclude`, and per the user's global ignore file. Each of
those is a decision the developer already made about their own tree. A pattern list maintained
inside Engram would be a worse, staler copy of a file the repository already ships, and it would
disagree with the developer on their own project. Untracked-but-not-ignored counts as theirs
because a file written five minutes ago is exactly the file an agent is about to be asked about.

The list still exists, for the directory that is not a checkout — and there it does all the
work, which is why it is not the four .NET-and-JavaScript patterns it started as. Measured
across a workspace of 38 repositories: the non-checkout directories walked 25,092 and 23,828
files, almost entirely `stable-audio-tools/.venv` (33,000 files), `venv/lib` (26,074) and
Swift's `.build` (11,780). None of the original patterns matched any of them. With Python,
Swift, Rust and Go patterns added, the same two directories walk 150 files in 60 ms and 2 files
in 27 ms — from 4,485 ms and 3,257 ms. The failure mode being written against is a list that
only knows the languages its author happened to be using.

**What is worth reading is decided by content, never by extension.** An extension list is
infinite, always out of date, and wrong in both directions: generated blobs ship as `.h`, and
real scripts ship with no extension at all. A NUL byte in the first 8 KB is what git itself uses,
and it costs a read the indexer must do anyway. Two shape rules catch what survives that — a
size cap, and a mean-line-length cap for minified and bundled files.

The mean, not the longest line, and that distinction was paid for. A longest-line rule at 2048
bytes rejected this repository's own `plugin/hooks/hooks.json`: 61 hand-written lines, 4,018
bytes, one 2,662-byte line among them. One long line is a formatting choice; being *made of*
long lines is what generated means. Across this repository's 175 tracked text files the mean
line is 38 bytes at p50, 49 at p90, 68 at p99 and 170 at worst, while a minified bundle runs to
thousands — the populations are separated by more than an order of magnitude, so 400 sits in a
gap rather than on a knife edge.

**Excluding is the safe error, and that sets every default.** A file wrongly indexed becomes
facts, and facts are append-only: `compact` and `repair` may not delete a fact body (D8), and
nothing downstream can distinguish a fact derived from a bundle from one derived from real
source. The only cure is `forget`, by hand, after the noise has already been served to a model.
A file wrongly excluded costs one line of config and a re-index. So the filter excludes when
unsure — and every skip is counted and reported (`engram scan`), because an over-eager rule
must show up as a number rather than as a repository that mysteriously has no code facts.

One consequence worth stating: pattern matching is hand-written rather than translated to a
regular expression. The regex version worked and passed the same tests; it cost 630,240 bytes of
published binary by linking `System.Text.RegularExpressions`, and binary size is a latency
decision here because the `file-touched` budget's remaining headroom is all process start.

### D30 — The explainer describes the ranker that runs, not the one that was planned

D21 specifies what `engram explain` reports: lexical rank and BM25 score, vector rank and cosine
distance, salience contribution, fused RRF position, provenance tier. Building it revealed that
**four of those five do not participate in recall today.**

`engram_recall` calls `RecallEngine.Pack`, which orders facts by *how many distinct query terms
each one contains*. `fact_fts` is maintained by triggers and read by nothing on the recall path.
`fact_vec` is queried only by its own tests. The `salience` table has no writer. Written to D21's
letter, `explain` would have reported a ranking that does not happen — which is the exact failure
D21 exists to prevent, one layer up.

So two things are decided here.

**The explainer shares the ranker's code, it does not reimplement it.** `Explain` and `Pack` call
one `BuildCandidates` and one `ApplyBudget`; `Pack` renders the digest afterwards and `Explain`
returns the candidate list. A separate implementation would be a copy that drifts, and the drift
would be invisible precisely because the explainer is the tool one would use to notice. The guard
is a test asserting the packed lines equal the digest's lines; breaking it by re-sorting inside
`Explain` fails three tests.

**Lanes are reported by observed state, not by intended role.** `term overlap` reports RANKING;
`fts5` and `vector` report *idle — answerable, read by nothing*; `salience` and `RRF fusion`
report *not built*. That disagreement is the deliverable, not an apology for one: a fact BM25
ranks first and the shipped ranker never scores is evidence about whether fusing them is worth
doing, available **before** the fusion is written rather than after.

**What it found within minutes of existing.** Term overlap matches literal lowercased tokens;
FTS5 tokenizes with `porter`. So recall is blind to morphology. Measured against Engram's own
seeded corpus, on twelve plurals of words that corpus uses: **eight had facts the ranker never
scored, and six returned "no facts matched" while FTS5 ranked the right fact first.** The
singular controls find those same facts — `pragma` → 1 candidate, `pragmas` → 0; `connection` →
1, `connections` → 0. Nine of twelve singulars match, and every one of their plurals returns
nothing.

That is not a ranking-quality problem, it is a false negative with a side effect: recall answers
`coverage: none` and tells the model to *"discover and engram_remember what you find"*, so the
agent re-derives a fact the store already holds and writes a near-duplicate — and facts are
append-only, so `compact` may not clean up after it (D8). Fixing it is a change to the ranker and
is therefore sequenced with step 8 rather than smuggled into the explainer, which is the point of
building the explainer first.

`explain` is read-only, including the vector lane — embedding a query is a provider call, never a
write, and nothing here touches salience counters. An explainer that recorded an access would
move the ranking it was asked to explain, and the effect would be invisible because the tool that
would reveal it is the one causing it. A test asserts the row counts are unchanged across two
explains.

**The fix: fuse the lanes, do not swap one for the other.** Recall now draws `fact_fts` to
`seed_k` and fuses it with term overlap by reciprocal rank, `k = 60`. Replacing overlap with FTS5
was the tempting one-line version and it is wrong, because the two lanes miss different things:
FTS5 stems and reads the predicate but cannot index the subject's display name, while overlap
reads the subject but matches literally. Swapping trades one class of false negative for another
and the tests would not have noticed.

RRF rather than a weighted sum, because there is no honest weight to pick: `bm25` returns an
unbounded negative whose scale depends on the corpus, and overlap returns a small count. Any
constant reconciling them would be a number nobody could defend. Reciprocal rank throws the
magnitudes away and keeps only the order, which is the part both lanes agree means something. It
also lands on the right emphasis by construction: at `k = 60` the gap between rank 1 and rank 2 is
1/61 − 1/62 ≈ 0.0003, while a fact both lanes found scores nearly double one only a single lane
found. Fusion rewards **agreement between lanes** far more than position within one, which is
exactly the confidence signal available here.

Measured after fusion, against the same corpus: the six queries that returned "no facts matched"
became **one**. Every other plural now matches or beats its singular — `hooks` 11 vs `hook` 10,
`settings` 5 vs `setting` 2, `indexes` 2 vs `index` 1.

**The last false negative was structural, and cost a schema version.** `pragmas` still returned
nothing because "pragma" appears in no fact body at all — only in the subject path
`/knowledge/dotnet-and-storage/pragma-foreign-keys-scope`. That is not a tail case: **30 of 45
live facts (67%) had at least one subject token absent from their body, 39 such tokens in total.**
An FTS5 external-content table can only index columns present on the content table, so the
entity's display name is genuinely unreachable — but `path` is denormalized onto `fact` (D2), it
is on the content table, and `unicode61` splits its slug on `/` and `-`. So schema version 2 adds
`path` to `fact_fts`, with a fourth trigger to re-index a fact whose path follows its entity on
rename. `bm25`'s IDF is what stops this flooding results: a segment appearing in every document
contributes almost nothing, so `/knowledge` does not match the store. Columns are weighted
equally, as the honest default until something is measured.

Rebuilding the index is a legal migration under D8 precisely because it destroys nothing
authored: external content means every indexed value is read back out of `fact`. The migration
carries its own copy of the FTS5 DDL, since an FTS5 table's columns cannot be altered in place and
parsing the statements back out of the schema file would fail silently on a reformatted comment.
The duplication is guarded by a test asserting a migrated store and a fresh one have byte-identical
`sqlite_master` rows for the table and its triggers.

`[retrieval]` stops being decorative: `default_budget_tokens` and `seed_k` are now read by both
`recall` and `explain`. `graph_hops` and `recency_half_life_days` stay deliberately unread — the
features behind them do not exist, and a setting that silently does nothing is worse than an
absent one.

---

### D31 — Snapshots are triggered by change, thinned by generation, and taken before every migration

The store had no copy of itself anywhere, and nothing that would notice it leaving. This was
written after `engram.db` disappeared from a live instance with the rest of the home untouched —
no logged command removed it, the test suite provably does not (a sentinel database under a
redirected `HOME` survives a full run), and the installer's verification home is a real
`mktemp -d`. The cause is still unknown, which is the strongest argument available for the
feature: the recovery story cannot depend on first explaining the loss.

**`VACUUM INTO`, never a file copy.** The store runs in WAL mode, so a committed fact lives in
`engram.db-wal` until something checkpoints it. Copying `engram.db` alone was measured here to
produce not a stale database but an unusable one — the copy had no `fact` table at all, because
everything was still in the log. `VACUUM INTO` reads through one transaction, writes a single
consistent compacted database, and takes no write lock, so a snapshot never blocks a hook trying
to record a fact. Written to `.partial` and renamed, because a truncated file whose name says it
is a snapshot is worse than no snapshot: it is the one you would reach for.

**Change is the trigger; the interval is only a ceiling.** A clock-driven backup copies identical
bytes twenty-four times on a day nothing was written and then thins twenty-three of them back
out — work performed solely to undo itself. Facts are append-only, so counts over the
authored-truth tables make a monotonic fingerprint that moves on a write, a close, a rename (which
lands a row in `entity_alias`), or a new edge. Derived state is excluded deliberately: the FTS
index and salience are rebuildable (D8), so a snapshot taken because an index changed is a copy
taken for no reason. Measured: 101 session-start invocations produced exactly one snapshot.

The comparison is against the newest snapshot's own fingerprint, read back out of it, rather than
a watermark kept on the side. A watermark is a second copy of the truth that starts lying the
moment someone deletes a snapshot by hand; a fingerprint read out of the file it describes cannot
drift from it.

**Retention is generational because the failure modes are.** Losing an hour of facts is noticed at
once; losing a fortnight is noticed long after a flat window of hourly snapshots has rolled past.
Keeping the newest in each of the last 24 hours, 7 days and 4 weeks spends a bounded number of
files on a reach measured in months. Zero is refused for any retention count — it reads like "keep
none", and one mistyped line deleting every snapshot is the failure the feature exists to prevent.

**Session start spawns it detached.** A snapshot is a `VACUUM` over the whole store, unbounded as
the store grows, and hooks have budgets; the parent pays one `fork` and never waits. Sessions are
also when facts get written. A timer would need a daemon that is not always running — hooks write
facts whether or not the server is up — and a cron entry would be a second installation surface to
own and uninstall (D28). Measured: session start goes from 11.0/12.2 ms to 13.8/13.5 ms, **+2.0 ms
mean over 100 runs**. This does not touch `file-touched`, whose rule is about that hook and its
per-edit rate, not about hooks (D4).

Fanning out from session start needed a lock, which the tests found rather than the design:
thirty concurrent session starts spawned thirty backups, which stampeded the store and outlived
the temp home the harness was deleting. One holder does the work and the rest exit at once.
`DeleteOnClose` rather than a pid file with staleness rules — the kernel closes the handle however
the process dies, so there is no such thing as a lock left behind by a crash.

**Every migration snapshots first.** It is the one moment Engram's own code rewrites structure
rather than appending to it, and it does so unattended, on open, before anyone has decided today is
a good day for it. The first migration shipped one commit before this without that guard.

**Restore is dry-run first, and assumes it is being used on a bad day.** It refuses a snapshot from
a newer schema version rather than reading it wrongly; it preserves the current store before
overwriting it, falling back to moving the raw bytes aside when that store will not open, because a
store worth restoring over is disproportionately likely to be one that will not open; and it
removes the stale `-wal`/`-shm`, since a log belonging to the database that was just replaced is
corruption with a clean exit code.

**Three guards did not survive falsification and were rewritten rather than kept.** The retention
rule's unconditional keep-the-newest is unreachable through config, since the counts are floored at
one and the newest snapshot always leads its own hourly bucket — it is reachable only from code
constructing settings directly, which is what its test now does. The WAL cleanup passed with the
code deleted twice, because anything that opens SQLite on the way past makes SQLite unlink the
sidecars itself; it only does work when the database file is gone and its log is not, which is
exactly the state this instance was found in. And the fingerprint's closed-fact count is genuinely
redundant — both paths that set `valid_to` also write a supersession row — so it is kept as cheap
insurance with a note saying no test can guard it, following the precedent set by the
`foreign_keys` pragma.

---

### D32 — The fact journal is plain text, rewritten whole, and replayed additively

D31 deferred this and predicted the wrong shape for it, which is worth recording because the
prediction was reasonable and still wrong. The claim was that append-only facts make the journal
incremental and nearly free. On building it, the whole-file rewrite won on every axis that
mattered, and the incremental version was abandoned rather than shipped.

**Why the rewrite beats the append.** Appending only what is new needs a watermark, and a
watermark is a second copy of the truth that starts lying the moment anyone touches the file — the
same objection that put the snapshot fingerprint inside the snapshot rather than beside it. It also
needs an ordering rule the append version has no natural place to enforce: a fact and the fact that
superseded it must be written closed-then-open, because for as long as both look live they violate
the live-fact uniqueness constraint. A whole-file rewrite has neither problem. Every line carries
that fact's final validity, replay is one pass, and the file can be checked against the store by
reading it. The cost traded away is O(facts) per run instead of O(new facts), which at an hourly
ceiling in a detached process is not yet a cost; when it is, it will be a measured change.

The rewrite is atomic — `.partial` then rename — for a sharper reason than the snapshots have.
Whole-file rewriting is the one operation that could destroy the archive it maintains, so a process
killed halfway must leave the previous complete journal exactly where it was.

**It is the tier that outlives a schema.** A `.db` snapshot restores only into the version that
wrote it, which is why the version is in its filename and why restore refuses a mismatch. The
journal is addressed by path and predicate rather than by row id and table shape, so it replays
forward into any later schema. Measured on the published binary: a home holding nothing but
`facts.jsonl` replayed to 45 facts that then ranked through the real retrieval path, and a second
`--apply` wrote none of them again.

**Closed facts are journalled too.** A journal of only what is currently believed cannot
reconstruct why it is believed. The supersession chain is the record of a mind changing, and D8
protects it as authored truth exactly like the facts themselves.

**Replay is additive, and that is the whole difference from restore.** Restore replaces a store
with an older one; replay reads facts into whatever is already there and skips what it recognises,
matching on subject, predicate, body and `valid_from`. So it is safe against a live store, against
a half-recovered one, and against being run twice. It is deliberately not a merge: nothing in it
rewrites or closes a fact the target already had. Facts are append-only, and a recovery tool that
could silently retire live beliefs would be worse than the problem it was called to fix.

Two smaller calls. `session_id` is dropped, because a session number means nothing in a store that
did not host that session — the provenance that survives is what travels: subject, predicate, how
it was learned, and when. And a malformed line is skipped and counted rather than fatal, because
this file is read when something has already gone wrong, and refusing to recover four thousand
facts over one truncated line is the tool preferring its own tidiness to the user's data.

Two of the eight guards written for this did not fail when first broken, and both breaks were
wrong rather than the guards. Opening the `.partial` file in append mode changes nothing — it is
freshly created every run — so the honest falsification is to write straight to the live journal in
append mode, which is precisely the rejected design; it fails. And `if (false)` will not compile
under warnings-as-errors, so forcing the `apply` parameter true does the same job. The second
attempt at each failed as intended, which is the only evidence that either guard exists.

**Amended: what replay cannot write, it skips and counts.** The rule above — never rewrite or close
what the target already had — collided with the schema, and the schema won in the worst possible
way. `ux_fact_live` permits one live fact per subject and predicate, so a journalled belief the
target disagrees with cannot be inserted without closing the target's, which this decision forbids.
Nothing said what to do instead, so the insert simply violated the index and `Replay` propagated a
`SqliteException` that `ReplayInto` turned into "replay failed and nothing was written". Measured:
a journal replayed into a home that had been through `init` — which arrives holding the seeded
corpus under the same subjects and predicates — recovered **nothing at all**. That is the tool
failing precisely in the situation it exists for, since a rebuilt home is an initialised one.

Skipping is the only move left: the constraint forbids two, and D8 forbids closing one. So the
conflict is counted and reported, separately from `AlreadyPresent`, because "already there" and
"not recovered" are the two answers someone running a recovery tool is trying to tell apart. A
conflicted fact gets no `idMap` entry, so a supersession aimed at it comes out unresolved rather
than pointed at an unrelated row. Only live facts can collide — the index is partial on
`valid_to IS NULL` — so a closed journal fact still lands beside whatever is believed now and adds
to the record of how the belief got there.

**One of the five new guards was worthless and the falsification is what said so.** The in-journal
duplicate check exists for the *dry run*: an apply sees its own inserts through the transaction and
resolves a merged bundle's second live fact without any help. The test asserted the apply, so
deleting the check left it green. Rewritten to assert the dry run — the only caller that has no
transaction to see through — it fails on the break, which is the difference between a guard and a
decoration.

### D33 — Choosing an embedding provider is a command, and the line it writes says who wrote it

`model install` ended by printing two lines to paste into a config file. Everything needed to
write them was already in hand at that moment: the model id, the provider it implies, the path to
the file. What was left was the step where a typo produces an instance that looks configured and
is silently lexical-only. So `engram init --with-embeddings` presents the rungs and writes the
answer, and `model install <id> --use-it` does the same for a model already being downloaded.
Downloading is still not the same as choosing — staging a second model before switching to it is a
real thing to want — so the config edit is asked for rather than assumed.

**Three rungs, and the first one is a real answer.** `none` is lexical recall, which works; `local`
is a model Engram runs from a file in the home; `endpoint` is anything already serving
`/v1/embeddings`. The lane costs disk, memory and startup, so a picker that treated the largest
model as the obvious choice would be selling something. Only the endpoint rung asks for `dim`, and
it asks rather than defaulting, because a wrong width does not fail — it produces vectors that
never match anything, which is the worst available way for this to be wrong.

**Line surgery, not a TOML round-trip.** The shipped config is mostly prose explaining these very
choices. Parsing it into a model and serializing it back yields a valid file with the
documentation deleted: it would still work and would no longer explain itself. So one line changes
and every other byte survives, including the commented-out suggestions the user never uncommented,
which count as absent rather than as decisions.

**The line records who wrote it.** The rule is that nothing overwrites a value it did not write,
and the obvious implementation — compare against the shipped default — refuses its own previous
edit the second time it runs, because by then the file no longer matches the shipped default. The
tests found this rather than the design. The fix is a marker comment on the line itself:
`provider = "local"   # written by engram`. It lives with the value instead of in a state file
beside the config, because a record kept elsewhere starts lying the moment someone edits the line
it describes — the same reason the snapshot fingerprint lives inside the snapshot (D31). The no-op
check then has to compare values rather than file text, or stamping the marker would itself count
as a change and the config would be backed up and rewritten to say what it already said.

**No terminal means no answer.** Piped or redirected, the rungs are printed and nothing changes,
with the flag form shown instead. A prompt that reads EOF as an answer picks on the user's behalf,
and this is the file where being wrong is quiet. With `--provider` given outright, that is the
explicit intent the dry-run rule exists to require, so it acts.

For `local`, the download runs before the config is written. A config naming a model that is not on
disk describes an instance that cannot start, and it would have been written by the very command
someone ran to avoid getting this wrong by hand.

**Amended: leaving the rest of the file means retired keys live in it forever.** Changing one line
is what protects a user's prose, and the cost is that a setting Engram stops reading is never
removed from the configs that already have it. Three are in that state — `model_path`, `threads`
and `idle_unload_minutes`, real until the embedder moved inside the server — and they read exactly
like live settings. `model_path` is the one that matters: it looks like it selects the weights, and
`EmbeddingModels` has selected them since. A person reading their own config would reasonably
believe it does something.

So `EmbeddingSettings.Retired` is an explicit list of key and replacement, and `doctor` warns for
each one present. Explicit rather than "any key not in the shipped default", because `ConfigFile`
is deliberately lenient about unknown keys — that is how a config survives a version bump and how
someone leaves themselves a note — and reporting those would be doctor calling a user's own choice
a fault, which D37 says is how people stop reading it. `Warn`, never `Broken`: a line that does
nothing is untidy, not wrong, and exit 1 stays for what is actually broken.

They ride a separate `Ignored` list rather than `Problems`, and that is the load-bearing half.
`Problems` clears `IsUsable`, so folding retired keys in would have switched the vector lane off
for every config old enough to contain one — turning a cosmetic report into an outage on upgrade,
delivered by the change meant to tidy up. The guard for it asserts `IsUsable` stays true with all
three present.

---

### D34 — The endpoint is asked its vector width, never told it

D33 shipped the picker still asking a human for `dim`, and flagged that as the weak point. It is
the one embedding setting that does not fail loudly when it is wrong. A wrong endpoint refuses to
connect; a wrong model name comes back an error; a wrong width produces vectors that are stored,
compared and ranked, and that match nothing — retrieval degrades into confident noise and no
component anywhere reports a fault. It is also not derivable from the model name, because an
endpoint may serve a quantized or truncated variant under the same label. So the number is
obtained by observation: `engram embed --probe` embeds one short string and reports the length of
what comes back.

**The probe is the one caller allowed past the width check.** `HttpEmbedder` throws when a returned
vector disagrees with its configured width, which is right on the write path and impossible at
probe time, when the configured width is the question. Rather than duplicate the request and
response plumbing, the send and parse were extracted and the assertion left in the embedding path
alone. Falsified: deleting the assertion still fails `OpenAi_WithTheWrongWidth_Throws`, so the
extraction did not carry the guard away with it.

**A provisional width of 1.** `EmbeddingSpace` refuses a non-positive width — correctly, since a
zero-width space is meaningless everywhere else — so the probe has to construct one before it knows
the answer. One is the smallest lie that constructs, and the probe path is the only code that ever
sees it, where it is never compared against anything.

**The probe runs against a configuration that is incomplete by definition**, so the settings' own
problem list is set aside for it: that list is complaining the width is missing, which is what the
probe was called to find out. Everything else the factory checks still applies — provider,
endpoint, and the API-key rule for a non-local host. The caller still sees the problems; they are
just not grounds for refusing to ask.

Consequences, each of which removes a question someone previously had to answer from memory:
`init --with-embeddings` asks the endpoint before asking the user, and falls back to asking only
when the endpoint will not say; `init --provider openai-compat --endpoint … --model …` no longer
needs `--dim` at all; and `embed --probe` against an already-configured instance reports a
disagreement between the config and reality, which is a fault that had no other way of surfacing.
A `local` provider is answered without a request, since the width is a property of a file Engram
already has the specification for.

The probe reads and does not write unless `--use-it` is given. It is what you run when you are not
sure what is out there, and a diagnostic that edits your config as a side effect is not one.

One guard here is unreachable and is kept anyway, following the `foreign_keys` precedent: the
explicit "no model named" check cannot change whether a request is sent, because the factory
already refuses to build an embedder without one. What it changes is the sentence the user reads —
the factory's mentions the missing `dim`, which during a probe is the question rather than the
fault. So the test asserts the message rather than the silence, and that assertion does fail when
the check is removed.

### D35 — `local` runs llama.cpp's server as a child, and the question about bindings dissolves

> **Superseded in part by D45.** The transport is now in-process LLamaSharp, and `server_path`,
> found-not-fetched, and the llama-server doctor check are gone. What survives is the paragraph
> below on `EmbedderFactory`: it was reasoned from ownership, not from process shape, and D45
> inherits it unchanged. Read D45 before acting on anything else here.

`provider = "local"` had been carrying an open question — whether a .NET binding to llama.cpp can
run encoder-only BERT models at all — and the answer turned out not to be needed. D1 already keeps
llama.cpp out of the AOT binary, so the only real choice was which out-of-process shape to use, and
llama.cpp ships a server that speaks the same `POST /v1/embeddings` that `OpenAiCompatibleEmbedder`
already speaks and `embed --probe` already tests. A binding in a sidecar would have needed its own
project, its own IPC, its own native loading, and its own answer to the BERT question — to
reimplement something already installed. So local costs a process launch and **no new embedding
code**. The unconfirmed claim was not resolved; it was made irrelevant, which is the better outcome
and the reason it is recorded here rather than left on the backlog.

**Found, not fetched.** Three places in order — `[embedding] server_path`, `lib/` under the Engram
home, then `PATH`. Engram downloads `sqlite-vec`, which is one small extension with one digest per
platform; llama.cpp is a large native artifact whose build varies by accelerator, and pinning
digests across every platform-times-accelerator combination is exactly the packaging burden D28
declines. A package manager or a local build already does it better, and D28's two requirements —
Metal on a Mac, CUDA elsewhere — are properties of llama.cpp's own builds rather than of anything
Engram could ship. A `server_path` that is set but missing is an error, never a reason to fall
through: running a *different* llama-server than the one someone named is worse than running none,
because nothing in the result says which answered.

**Launching cannot live in `EmbedderFactory`.** This is the load-bearing decision. Creating an
embedder is cheap and unowned everywhere it happens — `RetrievalExplainer` calls the factory purely
to ask whether a vector lane exists and drops the result, and no caller disposes what it gets. Had
the local case started a server there, a readiness check would have loaded a model and every recall
would have leaked one. So the launch lives behind `LocalRuntime`, an object somebody has to hold
and can therefore dispose, and the factory only ever attaches to a runtime already running. Without
one, local resolves to a sentence naming the process that does host it.

Ownership follows from that. The MCP server registers `LocalRuntime` as a container singleton, so
the backlog writer and the query side share one loaded model instead of two, and the container
stops the child by the same machinery that stops everything else. `explain` builds and disposes its
own, because it is a diagnostic whose entire job is answering whether the vector lane really works
— paying seconds to load a model is the point of running it, not a cost to avoid.

Two arguments are not defaults and are worth the words. `-ngl 99` offloads every layer: these
models are 25–640 MB, there is no case where splitting one is right, and omitting it is the
difference between Metal and a CPU fallback. `--batch-size` and `--ubatch-size` are pinned to the
served window because llama.cpp will not pool an embedding across physical batches — an input
longer than the micro-batch is refused outright, and the 512-token default sits well inside the
range a long fact reaches. The served window is capped at 8192 rather than taken from the model,
since those batch buffers are sized to it and qwen3's 32k allocation dwarfs anything Engram puts
through it; facts and queries are sentences.

Verified on the published binary against a stand-in server, which is enough to exercise everything
Engram owns — locating, launching, health-waiting, embedding, killing — without llama.cpp installed
to run the suite. What it cannot prove is that the real server accepts these arguments; only running
one does. Eight guards were falsified. The one worth naming is disposal: with `Dispose` broken, a
single test run left **seven** stand-in servers alive on the machine, which is what the guard is
for. llama-server does not exit when its parent does, so a leaked handle keeps a model resident
until somebody notices.

### D36 — One vector lane, fused into recall, so the explainer keeps describing what runs

The vector track was complete and disconnected. `sqlite-vec`, the index, the backfill, the width
probe, the provider picker and the local runtime all existed and all worked, and
`RecallEngine.Pack` had no vector parameter at all — `engram_recall`, the tool agents actually
call, was lexical-only. The code said so itself: the one vector query in the system reported
`LaneState.Idle` and the words "answerable, read by nothing on the recall path". Accurate, and the
entire embedding investment was sitting behind it.

**One implementation, because D30 is a promise about drift.** The query lived inside
`RetrievalExplainer`, where it was correct to put it when nothing else queried vectors. Giving
recall a lane of its own would have made two, and the moment either was tuned the explainer would
have been describing a ranker that no longer ran. So the lane moved to `VectorLane`, which both
call, and the explainer's job shrank to reporting what it returned. The explainer also had to start
running it *before* the fusion rather than after: reporting a lane that ran too late to affect the
result is the same defect wearing a different hat.

**RRF absorbed a third lane with no retuning**, which is the payoff for the choice D30 made
originally. Ranks are comparable by construction, so the fusion is one more `Reciprocal` term; had
the lanes been combined by score, a vector distance would have needed a weight against bm25 that
nobody could justify. A regression test pins the no-vector case to byte-identical output, because a
third term that shifts scores when the lane contributed nothing would retune the other two by
accident.

Two properties matter more than the ranking. **Recall can never fail because the lane failed** —
every stop returns a reason and an empty ranking, so a provider that is down costs vector hits and
nothing else. Configuring embeddings must not be more dangerous than leaving them off. And **the
lane costs nothing when embeddings are off**: the factory refuses before any request, and the
parsed settings are passed in rather than re-read, because recall is a hot path and re-parsing a
TOML file per query to answer a question already answered buys nothing.

**A correction worth recording.** The lane loads `sqlite-vec` on the connection in hand, and the
first explanation written for that — belt and braces against connection pooling — was wrong.
`EngramDatabase.Open` already loads it on every connection and deliberately discards the result,
because an instance without embeddings is the ordinary case there. The lane's load is how it
obtains a state it must report: "sqlite-vec is not installed" sends someone to fetch it, while "no
vector index in this store yet" sends them to build an index they cannot build. Different advice,
and only the load call tells them apart. This surfaced during falsification — removing the call
broke no test, because every vector test had the extension installed. The test that catches it is
the one that deliberately installs nothing, and it does not skip when `sqlite-vec` is absent, since
absence is its subject.

Nine breaks attempted, each verified applied. Eight failed a test. The ninth could not be broken:
removing the null-vector short circuit does not compile, because `VectorIndex.Search` takes a
non-nullable `float[]` and the nullable analysis refuses it — a stronger guarantee than a test, and
recorded here so nobody adds a test that pretends to guard it. Measured end to end against real
`sqlite-vec` and a stand-in endpoint that maps text to concepts: a fact sharing no term with the
query comes back from `engram_recall`, and the same query with the lane off returns nothing, which
is the control that makes the first result mean anything.

### D37 — `doctor` reads the instance and refuses to repair it

Every `Problems` list in the settings readers, and the never-throw contract on `EmbedderFactory`
that returns a `Reason` instead of an exception, were built for a reader that did not exist. Until
now `explain` was the only thing that surfaced any of it, and only for the retrieval path — so a
local model with no weights, an endpoint serving a different width than the config claims, a
`sqlite-vec` that failed to load, and a config line that would not parse were all diagnosable in
principle and invisible in practice. `engram doctor` is that reader.

**It opens the store with `Open` and never `OpenInitialized`, and this is the decision the rest
follows from.** `OpenInitialized` migrates an out-of-date schema on open, and D31 makes that
migration snapshot first. Reaching for it here would not merely be a side effect: it would make
the single most useful thing doctor can say — *your store is a schema behind* — unsayable, because
asking the question performs the answer. A diagnostic may not repair the state it was asked to
describe. The end-to-end test snapshots every file in the home by size and mtime around a doctor
run and asserts nothing moved, which fails on the new file in `backups/` well before anyone
notices the version changed.

The same rule at the other end of the command. `provider = "local"` is checked by looking for the
weights and for `llama-server`, never by resolving an embedder, because resolving one launches
llama.cpp (D35). A diagnostic that started a model process to find out whether a model process
would start has both answered the question and changed it, and leaves several hundred megabytes
resident behind a command the user expected to read. The test installs a stand-in `llama-server`
that touches a marker file when executed and asserts the marker never appears.

**`Off` is not a failure, and the exit code says so.** Only `Broken` fails; `provider = "none"` is
a supported configuration (D18), a server that is not running is one the hooks and the CLI do not
need, and an unbuilt indexer is a fact about the milestone rather than a fault. A doctor that
reported red for a choice the user made is one people stop reading, which costs the real faults
their audience. Exit 1 therefore means *something is broken*, not *something is imperfect*, and
`doctor` is safe to put in a script.

**Every check runs inside a wrapper that turns a throwing check into one broken row.** Not
defensive habit: a diagnostic is reached for when something is already wrong, so the state most
likely to make a check throw is exactly the state someone is running it in. A report that dies on
its first bad check is useless precisely when it is needed.

**One network call, on a deadline of its own.** The endpoint is asked its width, because D34's
failure mode is silent — a mismatched `dim` errors nowhere and stores vectors that rank like
noise, so no amount of reading configuration can find it. `Diagnostics.ProbeDeadline` is three
seconds and deliberately replaces the configured timeout rather than honouring it: an indexing run
should wait a configured thirty seconds for a busy endpoint, and a person asking what is broken
should not. A merely slow provider is reported unreachable here, which is the right answer to *is
it answering now*, and is why the fix line names `engram embed --probe` — the command that waits.
Measured: a dead endpoint against a configured 120 s timeout returns in well under 30 s, and the
whole integration suite for this command runs in 612 ms.

Two things the checks are structured around rather than merely reporting. The check logic lives in
`Engram.Core` and only rendering lives in the command, on the same split as `RetrievalExplainer`
and `ExplainCommand`, so the tests assert on states rather than parsing text — and so a doctor
that reimplemented a check could not silently disagree with the code it reports on. And
`ClaudeSettingsPath` is the one input a sandboxed home cannot sandbox, since Claude Code's
settings live in the user profile wherever Engram lives; it is therefore overridable, because a
test that let it default would be asserting on whoever ran it.

`--json` is indented and omits null fixes, unlike `probe --json` which feeds a pipeline: this one
exists to be pasted into a bug report by someone who could not work out what was wrong. It is
covered end-to-end against the published binary rather than the JIT build, because a
source-generated `JsonSerializerContext` is exactly the shape that works under reflection and
fails once trimmed.

### D38 — `embed --rebuild` refuses while the server is running

Five places already told the user to run this command — two rows in `doctor`, the `SpaceMismatch`
comment in `VectorBackfill`, and two doc comments in `VectorIndex` — before any of them could.
`VectorIndex` had both halves waiting: `Clear`, which empties the table and keeps its shape, and
`Drop`, which removes the table and the space it pinned. What was missing was the thing that
chooses between them and then refills.

Which half runs is not the user's choice, because only one of the three ways an index goes stale
announces itself. A width change is caught by `vec0` at the row level. A change to what text gets
embedded is caught because `InputVersion` is pinned next to the model. But a *same-width model
swap* is caught by nothing: those vectors store cleanly, rank against each other, and produce
distances that look like ordinary numbers — the silent failure D18 names. So the plan reads the
pinned model and picks `Recreate`, and `--apply` only decides whether to proceed. Clearing where a
recreate was needed leaves the old pin in place, and every backfill pass afterwards then refuses
the very embedder the rebuild installed; that is a test, and it fails when the branch is swapped.

**The refusal is the design.** `EmbeddingBacklog` is the single owner of vector production — one
resident model per home, guarded by the pid file — and a running server holds an embedder built at
*its* startup. A rebuild prompted by a config change would therefore race a process still using
the old model, and lose: the server's own `EnsureCreated` would re-pin the recreated table to the
space the user had just moved away from. So the command refuses and says `engram stop` first. That
is not politeness about a lock; it is the only ordering in which the new space wins. It is tested
end-to-end against a real second process, because the check reads a real pid file through the real
`ProcessInspector`, and a test with fakes injected would be asserting on the fakes.

No snapshot, unlike a migration (D31). Every row here is derived from a fact body and an embedder
(D8), so a rebuild recomputes by definition and can destroy nothing authored. The cost is entirely
in embedder calls, which is why the dry run states the count before spending them.

Progress is a plain callback rather than `IProgress<T>`: the only implementation anyone reaches
for, `Progress<T>`, posts to the thread pool when there is no synchronisation context — which is
every context this runs in — and a CLI would print its batch lines interleaved with, or after, its
own summary.

### D39 — a spool entry names the file, and reading stdin is not what threatens the budget

`file-touched` wrote a single ISO timestamp per invocation and nothing else, so a thousand queued
edits answered exactly one bit between them: *something changed*. The hook is registered as
PostToolUse on `Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit`, and Claude Code puts the edited file in
`tool_input.file_path` on stdin — the payload was there the whole time and the hook never read it.
Nothing consumed the queue, so nothing noticed.

**Measured before changing it,** because D4's budget is the reason this hook is spartan and "read
stdin" sounds like exactly the sort of thing that breaks it. On the published binary, 100 runs each:

| | p50 | p99 |
|---|---|---|
| `file-touched`, no stdin | 8.67 ms | 9.64 ms |
| `file-touched`, payload piped but unread | 8.94 ms | 9.85 ms |
| `user-prompt` — parses stdin, opens the store, writes a fact | 9.61 ms | 10.56 ms |

Piping the payload in at all costs 0.27 ms. `user-prompt` does everything this hook would do
*plus* open the database and write, for 0.67 ms more than `file-touched` spent doing none of it.
So parsing is not what threatens this budget — opening the database is, and rule 4 stands
unchanged: this hook still never opens it. (The earlier figures in §1.5 were taken on a quieter
machine; what matters here is the difference between rows measured in one sitting, not the
absolute numbers.)

Recording the path strictly dominates the alternative. A consumer given paths can always coalesce
them into "something changed" and rescan; a consumer given timestamps can never recover which
files they were. The format is therefore a timestamp on the first line and an optional path on the
second — optional so the entries already on disk, written before this existed, still drain as an
edit whose target is unknown rather than as a corrupt file. That is not hypothetical: the queue on
a real instance held 1058 of them.

`SpoolReader.Drain` returns `SpooledEdit(At, Path)` and drops an entry it cannot parse rather than
throwing, because this is a queue written by a hook that swallows its own errors to protect the
budget — a truncated file is a thing that happens, and failing the whole drain over one would
strand every edit behind it. It deletes what it read *before* the caller has acted, which is a
durability hole that is tolerable only because a rescan is always available; a consumer that
cannot rescan must not be built on it as it stands. That is written on the method.

### D40 — the old `user-facts/` JSON is converted, not read

Before the fact store existed, user statements were kept one JSON file per statement under
`~/.engram/user-facts/`, each carrying its own `supersedes` and `retracts` pointers — a second,
weaker implementation of the validity window `fact` already has. Nothing in the current code reads
that directory or writes to it, which was verified rather than assumed: the newest file on the real
instance is timestamped an hour before the binary that replaced it was installed, and the shipped
binary contains no `user-facts` string at all. So an instance upgraded across that change keeps its
files and silently loses the memory in them. On this machine that was 38 files.

The import is a converter, not a reader. It produces `JournalFact` records and hands them to
`FactJournal.Replay`, the same path `backup replay` uses, because replay is already additive,
idempotent, and refuses to close a fact the target store already holds. That last property matters
more here than it does for a restore: this runs against a live instance with facts captured after
the cutover, and a migration that could retire them would be worse than the loss it was called to
fix. Writing a second writer would have meant re-earning all three.

**Addresses are computed by `UserFacts`, not invented here.** A migrated statement has to land where
a native capture of the same sentence would, or saying it again tomorrow files a duplicate beside
its own history. That means the path leaf is `FactStore.Fingerprint` of the text, and it is why this
is C# in the repo rather than a throwaway script — a reimplementation of that hash would agree until
it did not. A test asserts the payoff directly: import a statement, then call `UserFacts.Capture`
with the same sentence and watch it return null.

**A chain shares one address.** This is the case a naive converter gets wrong. The old model linked
a restatement to its predecessor *by id*, so the two texts differ and fingerprint to different
entities; written at their own addresses both would be live — two current beliefs where the user
expressed one that changed. Every member of a chain therefore takes the **root's** path and
predicate, which is exactly what `UserFacts.Restate` does for a live one, and the supersession is
expressed as `valid_to` + `superseded_by` rather than as a pointer only this file understands.
`RootOf` walks back through `supersedes` with a seen-set, because these pointers were written by a
store with no foreign keys and a cycle would otherwise hang the migration rather than fail it.

Retractions are operations, not statements: they close their target and are not themselves facts.
Where a statement is closed by both a restatement and a retraction, the **earlier** event is the one
that ended the belief. A pointer at an id that does not exist leaves its statement open and is
counted as a dangling link rather than dropped silently, and an unparseable file is counted rather
than failing the whole import — the reason to run this at all is that the data is already old.

It ships as `backup import [dir] [--apply]`, dry-run first like everything else destructive, and it
does not touch or delete the source directory: re-running it writes nothing, so the files stay as
their own backup. Measured on the real instance, in a copy of the home rather than the home:
38 files → 36 statements and 2 retractions, 11 chains, 0 dangling; the store went from 45 live facts
to 81 live and 13 closed, and a second `--apply` wrote 0. Four attempted breaks of the converter —
chain member keeping its own address, retraction treated as a statement, directive mapped to
`about-you`, address invented instead of fingerprinted — each failed a test.

### D41 — the edit queue is folded, not pruned, and session start does it

D39 gave `file-touched` a reason to write one file per edit and never read. It did not give anything
a reason to delete them. The consumer is the code indexer, which is not built, so the queue only
grows: 1102 entries on the author's instance, and rising with every keystroke that lands in a file.
A queue that grows without bound waiting for a consumer that does not exist is a defect in the
binary shipping today, whichever milestone the consumer arrives in.

The fix is not to prune by age or count, and the reason is worth stating because pruning is the
obvious move. **A consumer of this queue re-reads the file's current content.** The queue says
*which* files to look at, never what they said. So for a given path, knowing it was touched at t1,
t2 and t3 tells a consumer nothing that t3 alone does not — the redundancy is exact, and removing it
loses nothing rather than losing a little. Pruning by age would discard a path that is still dirty;
folding cannot. On the real instance this collapses 1102 entries to 1, because every one of them
predates D39 and carries no path, and D39's own argument settles that case too: a bare timestamp
answers one bit no matter how many of them there are.

Two rules, asymmetric on purpose. For a **path**, keep the **newest** — the timestamp there means
last touched, and the content is read fresh regardless. For a **pathless** entry keep the
**oldest**, because a bare timestamp's only possible use is as a watermark, *there are unindexed
changes at least this old*, and the earlier one is the safe reading of a set of them.

**It only ever deletes.** Nothing renames or rewrites a spool file, and that is what buys
concurrency safety without a lock: two compactions racing converge on the same directory; a
`file-touched` running alongside creates a name no listing contains, so its entry survives; a
`Drain` running alongside removes files the compactor would have removed, or files it would have
kept, which is not a loss because draining is consuming them. Surviving names still lead with
`DateTime.Ticks`, so `Drain`'s lexicographic sort is still chronological — asserted, because a
future compactor tempted to rewrite entries into one file would pass every other test.

**Unreadable is not unparseable.** The writer holds `FileShare.None`, so a compaction racing an edit
can be refused the read on Windows. An entry whose bytes could not be obtained is left alone;
deleting on a transient error would destroy an edit that was fine. An entry that *was* read and made
no sense is deleted, because `Drain` drops it anyway and keeping it means carrying it forever.

The bound does not rest on the assumption that a person edits few files: past 10,000 distinct paths
the newest are kept and the rest are reported, never dropped silently. That ceiling takes a
parameter so a test can watch it fire at a size a test can afford to write — a guard proven only by
argument is a guard nobody has seen fire.

**Where it runs is the part that matters.** `engram queue compact --apply` exists, but a bound that
depends on someone noticing is not a bound. Session start already forks one detached child for
`backup take --if-due` (D31), and that child is the housekeeping slot: it now runs the compaction
too, in the same fork, guarded by `--if-large` so an ordinary queue costs one directory listing and
no reads. `BackupLauncher` became `MaintenanceLauncher` to stop the name from lying. A second
`Process.Start` would have doubled the one cost the parent actually pays — the fork — to save
nothing, since both children are detached either way.

`doctor` still reports the queue as `Off` rather than a warning, because a backlog is the expected
state until the indexer exists and D37 reserves red for faults. Past the compaction threshold it
gains a fix, since a queue that large means the automatic pass has not been running. It counts and
does not read; `engram queue status` is where the more useful figure, how many distinct files are
behind the number, is printed, precisely so doctor does not open a thousand files to draw one row.

Six attempted breaks each failed a test: keep the oldest per path, keep the newest pathless, delete
what could not be read, skip the ceiling, ignore the threshold, and stop spawning the compaction at
session start. That last one is the only test that has ever covered the detached child at all —
`backup take --if-due` had been spawned untested since D31.

### D42 — a server's identity is its start time; a version gap is not a hang

`ServerLifecycle` proved a pid file still described *our* server by comparing two things: the
kernel's start time for that pid, and the executable path the process was launched from. The first
is the check. The second was quietly answering a different question — *was this launched from the
same file I am?* — and it made every honest answer wrong.

Measured on this instance: the installed binary reported the server up while a freshly built one
reported the same pid file dead, in the same second. That is not an edge case, it is what working on
Engram looks like. And it was not cosmetic in `stop`, which is what makes this a defect rather than
a wording problem. A path mismatch made `stop` delete the pid file, report "engram is not running",
and leave the server running with nothing left to address it by — no later `stop` from any binary
could find it, and recovery was `kill` by hand. `start` had the mirror bug: it deleted the record
and launched a second server against a bound port.

pid plus start time is already unique, and it is exactly the pair a recycled pid cannot forge — a
stranger that inherited the number started at a different instant. The path adds nothing to it. So
identity drops the path, and the guarantee that actually mattered is untouched because it never
rested on the path: nothing is terminated whose start time does not match what was recorded.

**Amended: the start time that identifies a server is the kernel's record, never .NET's
reconstruction of it.** On Linux `Process.StartTime` is `starttime` jiffies added to a per-process
*estimate* of boot time, so two processes reading the same pid disagree by hundreds of microseconds
and exact equality never holds — measured 24 of 24 cross-process reads unequal in a Linux container,
by up to 3636 ticks. The paragraph above is right that pid plus start time is unique; it did not know
to distinguish the kernel's value from .NET's rendering of it, and on Linux only the first is a
property of the process. Every `status` there answered `Reused` about a healthy server, so `stop`
did the damage described above on every invocation rather than in the rare case — which is what all
three Linux end-to-end failures in CI turned out to be.

Identity therefore compares an opaque start token (`/proc/<pid>/stat` field 22 plus the boot id on
Linux; the exact kernel start time elsewhere), the recorded `start_time` stays as display metadata,
and no comparison may ever convert between token and wall clock — the conversion is where the
estimate, which is the defect, lives. macOS and Windows keep the value and the code path they
already had, deliberately: their kernels store an absolute creation time, and a fix that does not
touch the platform this repo cannot test is a fix that cannot regress it.

**A tolerance was considered and rejected**, and the reasoning matters more than the conclusion
because the fitted version looks defensible. The error term is not scheduler jitter but the
difference between two boot-time estimates, each read off the realtime clock — so an NTP step or a
VM resume moves it without bound. Every finite window is therefore either smaller than a possible
clock step, which turns a deterministic failure into an intermittent one, or a number fitted to
hoped-for clock behaviour. It would also have rewritten the guarantee from "does not match" to
"approximately matches", and the start-time comparison has no backstop to absorb that: `Stop` never
runs the health check at all, and `Start` terminates precisely when the health check *failed* to
vouch, so `IsAnsweringForUs` proving `health.Pid == record.Pid` does no work on any kill path.

The path is demoted, not discarded. `StatusResult.LaunchedFrom` carries it, and `status` and
`doctor` print it only when it differs from the binary being asked — that difference is the entire
explanation for an otherwise baffling row, and printing it unconditionally would bury it in noise.

**A version gap got its own state.** A healthy server on another version used to collapse into
`Wedged`, whose text is "alive and not answering its health check" — said about a server that
answered immediately and correctly. That sends someone hunting a stuck process when what they have
is a server they have not restarted since upgrading. `VersionMismatch` says so plainly, and doctor
warns rather than reporting `Broken`, per D37: nothing is wrong with that server.

Splitting the states exposed the second half of the problem. Callers asked "is a server up?" by
testing `Kind is Running`, which is false for both `Wedged` and `VersionMismatch` — and both are
live processes holding whatever they loaded at startup. `embed --rebuild` refusing to run while the
server is up (D38) is the one that matters: under the old test it would have decided the server was
absent and raced it. `StatusResult.ServerIsAlive` is now the only way to ask, so the question cannot
be answered by enumerating states again and getting a different answer in each caller.

Seven attempted breaks each failed a test: restoring the path to identity (three tests), collapsing
`VersionMismatch` back into `Wedged`, narrowing `ServerIsAlive` to `Running`, dropping
`LaunchedFrom`, and inverting the doctor row's "only when it differs" condition.

The amendment added eight more, each applied and watched go red: reverting identity to the wall clock
(two tests), weakening the comparison to `token || wall clock`, making the token required so
pre-upgrade servers are orphaned, giving the legacy path a one-second window, cutting
`/proc/<pid>/stat` at the first `)`, sourcing the Linux token from `Process.StartTime` again — which
reproduces the original defect through the tier-3 test, *status called a live server dead* — and
ignoring the token so an altered pid file still identifies the server. The last two are the ones that
prove the tier-3 guard reaches the mechanism rather than a fake of it, and they fail on different
platforms by design: reader-independence cannot fail on macOS, and the altered-token half fails
everywhere.

### D43 — two session counts that do not subtract

`engram probe` warned: "N session(s) ran without Engram's MCP server reachable; memory was
unavailable in those sessions", with N computed as `hookSessions - mcpSessions`. Both halves of
that are wrong, and the second cannot be repaired by moving a threshold.

`session-start` is written by the hook and carries Claude Code's session id. `session-open` is
written by the MCP server on the first request of a session and carries the `Mcp-Session-Id` header
the transport minted. Measured on a real instance: 23 distinct hook ids
(`c2392759ab81425ab1874f717f5c30d6`, `ad5589fb-18fd-4767-…`) against 9 distinct MCP ids
(`WE-XuAF0PAlGRAYV7uyBWg`, `-JYLbJEIjzV6JVkA64mMpw`) — with **no value present in both sets**. They
are disjoint id spaces, so their difference is not a count of sessions, or of anything.

The first half fails independently of that. `McpSessionId` is registered `AddTransient` and injected
only as a parameter of the four tool methods, so nothing resolves it — and nothing writes
`session-open` — until a memory tool is actually called. A session in which the model never asked
for memory leaves a `session-start` and no `session-open` with the server up the whole time. That is
the ordinary case, so the warning fired constantly and asserted the reverse of the truth: an outage
report for sessions working exactly as designed. On the author's instance it claimed 14, and there
were none.

Nothing Engram records observes reachability. The `session-start` hook could probe `/health`, but
the server starts on demand and D37 already holds that "not running" is a supported state rather
than a fault, so "down at session start" would not be an outage either. The concept is not
measurable from this data and is barely meaningful against an on-demand server.

So the probe reports what it counted. Both counts print with a standing note that they are
disjoint, because the obvious thing to do with two session counts is subtract them. One comparison
survives: **zero MCP sessions against a non-zero hook count**, which needs no correspondence
between the spaces, since zero tool calls is zero however the ids are issued. It is warned and
worded as a question, not a conclusion — nobody having asked is as good an explanation as nothing
working — and it hands off to `doctor`, which can actually look.

`hook_gap_warning` is removed from the JSON rather than left null: a consumer reading `.difference`
was reading a number with no referent, and a null-valued key keeps that reading available.
`memory_never_reached` is a bool, because there is no quantity here worth reporting.

Four attempted breaks each failed a test: restoring `hook > mcp` as the condition, dropping the
`hook > 0` clause so an empty instance reports a finding, deleting the disjointness note, and
renaming the JSON key. The first failed four tests at once, which is the measure of how far the
wrong model had spread — those tests previously asserted it.

**The limitation underneath, now half closed (D73).** The MCP server cannot attribute a tool call
to the Claude Code session that caused it: the client does not forward its session id, and the
transport's is its own. The adoption percentages *this probe prints* are therefore still over MCP
sessions, a population that by construction called a tool at least once, and they are labelled that
way rather than rounded up to "sessions". But "what fraction of sessions used memory" — the number
D18 gates M4 on — now has a mechanism: the `tool-observed` hook records every Engram tool call under
the hook's own session id, so the question is answerable inside one id space, never by joining two.
Records begin once the plugin and binary ship together with that hook; none exist at the time of
writing, and the probe has not been taught to compute the number.

### D44 — coverage is lane agreement, as the spec always said

Spec §"Rules" specifies an "explicit `coverage` estimate (high/partial/none) computed from lane
agreement and score mass". The implementation was `ClassifyCoverage(int matchedFactCount)`:
`0 → none, 1-2 → partial, 3+ → high`. Neither lane agreement nor score mass — how many rows came
back.

That is not a measure of whether anything was found, because bm25 hands back a row for nearly any
query. Measured on the author's store: `weekend saturday personal activity outing` returned seven
candidates, six of which were engineering notes about lint tests, documentation absence and
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, reached through shared porter stems. The count called that `high`.
`permissions settings grant` did the same — seven candidates, one relevant.

The damage is not the label. `high` is exactly the value that suppresses the `gaps:` line, and the
spec calls that line "the instruction that trains the *discover → remember* fallback loop". So the
model was told memory had the question covered, and the loop that would have gone and found the
answer never fired. D12 additionally makes recall coverage *the* health metric, so the same number
was the evidence for the M4 gate.

Lane agreement was already computed and already printed by `explain` — "N found only by term
overlap, M only by fts5, K by both". Measured across all seven queries this instance has ever
recorded, K separates them without a fitted threshold:

| query | candidates | corroborated | old | new |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| plugin slash-command conventions | 39 | 8 | high | high |
| work done on Saturday | 32 | 7 | high | high |
| son's favourite game | 32 | 8 | high | high |
| weekend/outing | 7 | **1** | high | partial |
| permissions/settings/grant | 7 | **1** | high | partial |
| movie/cinema | 2 | 1 | partial | partial |
| movie/theater | 2 | 1 | partial | partial |

8, 7, 8 against 1, 1, 1, 1. Any cutoff in 2..7 gives the same answer, so the existing `3+` boundary
is kept rather than fitted to this sample — the point is that the quantity changed, not that a
number was tuned.

`none` stays keyed to the total candidate count, not the corroborated one. It means the store said
nothing and selects a different response shape (under five lines), so returning facts beneath
`coverage: none` would be a worse lie than the one this fixes. Only the high/partial boundary moves.

**Score mass is deliberately still open.** The spec names two inputs and this implements one. One
unmeasured knob is a rule; two are a preference, and there is nothing yet to measure the second
against.

Four attempted breaks each failed a test: classifying on the total again, counting a single lane as
agreement, dropping a lane from the tally, and keying `none` to corroboration. The third and fourth
are the ones a reviewer would not think to check, which is why `Corroborated` is public — the
boundary is the whole rule and it is unreachable from a unit test of `Pack`, since `CannedFact`
carries no numeric id and the lexical ranks that corroborate a candidate only exist against a real
store.

**What this says about the M4 gate, which is the reason the investigation started.** The instance
showed 28.6% of recalls returning `coverage: none`, which reads as a paraphrase-miss rate and would
be evidence for embeddings under D18. It is not. Both `none` recalls fired at 03:43:23Z and
03:43:30Z on 2026-08-05; the fact that answers them, `Jim saw the new Spider-Man movie…`, has
`valid_from` 05:05:56Z — 82 minutes later. They returned nothing because the answer had not been
written yet. That is cold start, not retrieval failure, and D18's gate is still unmet: **no recorded
query has yet missed a fact that existed at the time it was asked.**

### D45 — `local` loads llama.cpp, and stops asking the user to install it

**Decision.** `provider = "local"` loads a GGUF into the Engram process through **LLamaSharp**.
`LlamaServer.cs`, `LocalRuntime`'s child process, and the `[embedding] server_path` setting are
deleted. `LLamaSharp.Backend.Cpu` is referenced by default and carries `libggml-metal.dylib` on
osx-arm64; `-p:EngramGpu=cuda12` swaps it for the CUDA build.

**This reverses a decision that shipped, and the reversal is the point.** The plan specified
LLamaSharp from the start (D1, §1.5 spike E). The code that shipped instead ran llama.cpp's own
server as a child, and argued for it in a doc comment: the server already speaks the
`/v1/embeddings` that `OpenAiCompatibleEmbedder` speaks, so "local" cost a process launch and no new
embedding code. That argument is true and it was not the whole ledger. What it left out is that
llama.cpp's server is *found, not fetched* — three places, then a message — so `engram init` could
download 610 MB of weights, write a valid config, and produce an instance whose vector lane never
turns on. Spec §5 offers three rungs and the middle one did not work on a clean machine. The
reversal costs 478 lines of process management and one `LLamaSharpEmbedder`, and buys back the rung.

**The escape hatch that justified planning for a swap never fired.** D25 demoted spike E from
gating to informative in case LLamaSharp proved AOT-hostile. It did not — but neither is it AOT-free,
and the difference matters because the first publish here *passed*: nothing referenced LLamaSharp
yet, so the trimmer dropped the assembly whole. Once `LocalRuntime` used it, ILC reported IL3000 on
`NativeLibraryUtils.TryFindPath` reading `Assembly.Location`, which is empty under AOT. That is
plan §1.5's unresolved note about spike E's loading order, arriving as a build error rather than a
runtime mystery.

**And the answer to it is to do nothing, which took writing the wrong answer first.** `LlamaNative`
originally computed `runtimes/<rid>/native/` from `AppContext.BaseDirectory`, opened the ggml chain
by absolute path, and handed the result to `WithLibrary`. It worked. It was also never tested
against its own absence, and when it finally was — same published binary, path configuration
removed, nothing else changed — `embed --rebuild --apply` still loaded MiniLM and wrote 45 vectors.
IL3000 is a warning about a branch with a working fallback behind it, and reading a warning as a
failure produced 90 lines of code to prevent something that does not happen.

Removing it is not merely a simplification, because the code was wrong in a way the Mac could not
show. `WithLibrary` does not assist LLamaSharp's selecting policy, it replaces it — and that policy
chooses between builds that are not interchangeable. The backends do not agree on a shape: the CPU
package puts `libllama.dylib` directly in `native/` on macOS, but on linux-x64 ships only
`native/{noavx,avx,avx2,avx512}/` with nothing at the top, and `LLamaSharp.Backend.Cuda12` — itself
a metapackage over `.Cuda12.Linux` and `.Cuda12.Windows` — adds `native/cuda12/` beside them, with
no `libggml-cpu` and no `libmtmd`. A resolver short enough to write by hand picks by sort order, and
`avx` sorts before `cuda12`: the code that looked correct here would have run the weakest available
CPU build on every CUDA machine, silently and at full speed-looking. Detecting the host's AVX level
is what LLamaSharp already does. This is the general form of the mistake worth remembering — a
platform-specific correctness bug written *by* a workaround, on a machine where the workaround and
the bug are both invisible.

**One-shot process-wide configuration needs the lock held across the work, not the flag.** Removing
the path code left `LlamaNative.Prepare` doing one thing — register the log callback — and it was
still wrong: it set `prepared` inside the lock, released, then registered. A second thread reading
`prepared` therefore skipped ahead to `LoadFromFile` and loaded the library while the first was
still configuring, and LLamaSharp refuses configuration once anything is loaded. Two `LocalRuntime`
instances have two locks of their own and order nothing between them. Measured: 8 failures in 8 runs
with the flag released early, 0 in 8 with the lock held across the registration — deterministic on
this machine rather than a rare interleaving. It needs neither weights nor a GPU, because a
`LoadFromFile` that fails to parse a junk file has already loaded the native library by the time it
fails, so the tests that reach it are the ones that run everywhere. `Prepare` additionally treats
"already loaded" as non-fatal: nothing here can un-load a library, and failing an embedding that
would otherwise work in order to report on embeddings is the wrong way round.

**Suppressing IL2026/IL3050 costs a guard, so the guard is replaced.** Three warnings come from
JSON converters on `ModelParams` that Engram never invokes; `NoWarn` is per-project and cannot name
an assembly, so silencing theirs silences ours — and "no reflection-based serialization" was
enforced for free by the AOT publish. `NoReflectionJsonTests` now asserts every `JsonSerializer`
call in `src/` names a source-generated context. Implementing `IModelParams`/`IContextParams` to
dodge the warnings was considered and rejected: 38 members means restating 38 llama.cpp defaults as
Engram constants, trading three warnings about dead code for 38 chances to silently pick a different
number than the engine would.

**Measured.**

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| AOT binary | 21.84 MB | 22.25 MB |
| `file-touched` p50 | 9.44 ms | 9.51 ms |
| publish output | — | 121 MB, of which 5.7 MB is llama.cpp |
| load + embed 45 facts (MiniLM, Metal) | — | 0.46 s |

The +0.07 ms is noise, which settles the question CLAUDE.md's binary-size rule raises: 0.41 MB of
growth does not move the hook budget. Publish output needed a fix to get there —
`LLamaSharp.Backend.Cpu.props` copies per-RID only when it can see a `RuntimeIdentifier`, the SDK
does not pass one to RID-agnostic project references, and its fallback copied all seven platforms
(356 files, 210 MB). `Directory.Build.targets` trims to the target RID.

**`Pooling` joins the model registry, and it is the third silent knob.** `dim` fails silently (D34);
so does pooling. Measured on MiniLM: cos(mean, last) = 0.76, cos(mean, cls) = 0.50 — the wrong value
returns a correctly-shaped vector from the correct model that encodes something else. Worth stating
plainly because it bounds what the tests claim: flipping MiniLM to `Last` and re-running the
paraphrase test leaves it **passing**, since a degraded embedding still sorts a paraphrase above an
unrelated sentence. So the suite proves the setting reaches llama.cpp, not that the value is right.
Each row is an argument from the model's architecture, unmeasured against any retrieval benchmark.

**CUDA: packaging measured, execution not.** A `linux-x64 -p:EngramGpu=cuda12` build was run here
and its output inspected, which is what turned up the nested `native/cuda12/` layout above — so the
claim that the packaging works is measured rather than assumed, and `Directory.Build.targets` was
confirmed to trim the win-x64 half the metapackage drags in. What this machine cannot do is execute
on an NVIDIA device, so nothing is known about whether the CUDA build then *runs*. A failure
degrades to lexical recall with llama.cpp's own log attached, and `openai-compat` against a runtime
you start yourself is the standing fallback. Anyone with the hardware should treat
`-p:EngramGpu=cuda12` as unexercised past the point where the library loads.

### D46 — The primer records what it delivered, because the gates are unreadable without it

**Decision.** `session-start` and `subagent-start` write `long_term_fact_count` and
`tokens_returned` on their telemetry records. `fact_count` stays null on a primer record, and that
is deliberate.

**Found by trying to read D6's gate and discovering there was nothing to read.** M3 is held behind
evidence that missed recalls are substantially code-structure questions. Going to look, this
instance had 54 `session-start` and 336 `subagent-start` records with **every** memory field null:
they recorded that a session began and nothing about whether memory reached it. The only measured
read path was `recall` — 7 events, all on one day, none in the 24 hours after — and recall is a tool
the model chooses to call. So the record understated delivery by construction, because the primer
reaches every session and every spawn whether or not a tool call ever happens. A gate cannot be read
off a population that omits the path memory actually travels, and neither D6's gate nor D18's could
be.

**What the numbers do and do not say, stated now rather than after they are misread.** Recording
this does not make M3's gate met; it makes it answerable from here forward. Nothing retroactive is
recoverable — the 390 existing primer records stay null, so any comparison spanning this change is
between different things. And the counts still say nothing about *use*: a primer that arrives and is
ignored looks identical to one that is read. What becomes visible is delivery, which is the half
that was missing.

**`fact_count` stays null, which is the entire care in this change.** On a `recall` record it means
facts returned to the model. A primer returns no facts — it returns a count line and, at session
start, up to two example bodies. Filling the same field with a nearby number is precisely how the
probe's two session counts came to be subtracted from each other and printed as an outage for every
session in which the model simply never asked (D43). `long_term_fact_count` is what the store held
and `tokens_returned` is what was injected: both are well-defined for a primer, and both mean the
same thing on a recall record, so they are the two that can be compared across kinds without
inventing a correspondence. Two end-to-end tests hold the line, and the null one is the load-bearing
half.

**No new I/O.** The facts were already read to build the primer and the token estimate runs over a
string bounded at 300 tokens, so this adds a count and an arithmetic pass to hooks that had already
paid for the read. It is not `file-touched`, which may not open the store at all (D4).

### D47 — Tier 1 compiles at install, and its queries are registry data

**Decision.** tree-sitter and its grammars arrive as pinned, digest-checked source, compiled by
`cc` at install time into `~/.engram/lib/` — one core library, one dylib per grammar — by
`scripts/fetch-tree-sitter.sh`, an optional install step with the same tri-state reporting as
`--with-plugin`. The runtime loads them with `NativeLibrary.Load` (D1's side-load, D24's mechanism)
and never fetches anything. Extraction is driven by tree-sitter *queries* carried as columns on the
language registry row, exactly as D24 already carries tier-0 regexes: adding a tier-1 language is
one row naming a grammar and its query strings, with zero edits to the extractor.

**Compile-at-install adds no prerequisite this install did not already have.** Engram builds from
source on the machine that runs it — install.sh runs `dotnet publish`, Native AOT shells out to a C
toolchain and a linker, and the installer checks for clang today. Measured: the core library
(236 KB) compiles in 1.33 s with stock clang and the full TypeScript grammar (parser.c plus
scanner.c, 1.46 MB) in 0.40 s, so the step costs seconds on the machine that just spent minutes on
an AOT publish. The alternative was prebuilt binaries, and it fails on supply before it fails on
taste: tree-sitter grammars are distributed as generated C source — upstream publishes no binaries
to fetch — so prebuilt would mean Engram hosting its own artifacts through release infrastructure
this repo deliberately does not have. Each native dependency takes the path its upstream actually
ships: sqlite-vec is fetched prebuilt because its releases are binaries, llama.cpp links because a
NuGet backend exists (D45), tree-sitter compiles because source is what there is.

**Failure degrades, never blocks, and the two failure shapes stay distinguishable.** A fetch step
that fails — no network, no `cc` — leaves a finished install that indexes TS/JS at tier 0, under
the installer's optional-step rule. A grammar that loads but was generated against a different ABI
is refused by `ts_parser_set_language` returning false — the refusal channel whose accept half the
probe exercised (the current API answers ABI 14, and `ts_language_version` is now spelled
`ts_language_abi_version`). The loader reports "not installed" and "ABI mismatch" as distinct
downgrade reasons, because they are different problems with different fixes (D36's rule).
`ENGRAM_TREE_SITTER_DIR` overrides the lib directory with the Roslyn override's semantics: explicit
but missing means no tier 1, never a fallback to the default — a broken explicit configuration must
not silently become a different one.

**Queries are the extractor declaration D24 promised.** Hand-walking node kinds in C# would put a
switch per language behind the registry — the exact failure D24 exists to prevent. A query is a
string on the row, its `@name`/`@module` captures mirroring the `(?<name>)`/`(?<module>)` groups
the tier-0 patterns already use, and one query-driven extractor serves every row. Queries are
per-row by necessity, not just tidiness: `ts_query_new` validates node types against the grammar
and errors on unknown ones, so TypeScript's `interface_declaration` cannot appear in a JavaScript
query — which also means a wrong query fails loudly at first use rather than matching nothing
forever. TSX is its own grammar sharing the TypeScript row (`.tsx` resolves to `tree_sitter_tsx`);
the row's queries compile against both because the TS node vocabulary they use is common to the
pair. Every query is verified against the real compiled grammar before it lands in the registry —
a query literal nobody ran is a regex nobody tested.

**Tier 1 keeps paths grammar v1's addresses.** Top-level symbols only, addressed by
`CodePaths.ForSymbol`, same as tiers 0 and 2 — nested symbols are grammar v2's to define, as the
C# row already records. What tier 1 buys inside v1: names parsed instead of guessed, every
top-level declaration form, import sources including `require` and dynamic `import()`, and the same
merge implementation tier 2 uses, so handing a store between tiers supersedes nothing that did not
actually change. (Superseded by D48: tier 1 now writes v2 fragments through the same merge.)

### D48 — Grammar v2: scope chains and collision-only overload suffixes

**Decision.** A symbol fragment is the scope chain of declared names, outermost first, joined
with `/`, each name as written: `Widget.cs#Widget/Inner`, `FactStore.cs#FactStore/Remember`.
When several declarations in one file share a scope chain and a name, each appends its parameter
list as written — parentheses included, interior whitespace runs collapsed to a single space —
and declarations a syntactic view still cannot separate share one address, first wins, the same
rule partial classes already had. `CodePaths.GrammarVersion` moves 1 → 2, which
`code_index_version` turns into a full re-read on the first index after upgrade.

**The bump re-addresses nothing, by construction rather than by luck.** Every v1 extractor was
anchored to top-level declarations — the tier-1 queries all began `(program …)`, the sidecar
skipped any type whose parent was a type, tier 0's patterns bound to column ~0 — and a top-level
symbol's v2 fragment is spelled exactly like its v1 fragment. So v2 lands additively: existing
entities keep their ids and paths untouched, members and nested types appear as new entities, and
the one case where an address retires (a bare name that v2 splits into suffixed overload
siblings) closes its facts through the ordinary vanished-symbol path. The path-grammar document's
v1 sketch of adopt/merge re-keying was written for a migration that turned out not to exist; the
alias machinery (`entity_alias` via `MoveSubtree`) remains what renames use (D2).

**The suffix appears only on collision.** Rejected: arity or parameters on every callable —
that re-addresses a symbol every time a parameter is added, coupling the address to the part of
a declaration that changes most; the collision-only rule means the arrival of a first overload
is the only event that moves a sibling's address. Rejected: normalized type-only parameter
lists — extracting per-parameter types from a tree-sitter capture means parsing inside the
capture, and a "normalized" spelling is a second implementation of the language's type grammar
that drifts. As-written text from the same source file cannot disagree between tiers, because
both tiers read the same bytes; the only normalization is whitespace-run collapse, and it lives
in exactly one place (`DeepTier.Merge` — both deep tiers ship raw text and the merge composes
every fragment). Rejected: type parameters in the name (`Get<T>`) — every generic symbol pays
address noise forever to disambiguate a case (same name, same written parameters, different
genericity) that first-wins already resolves honestly.

**Scope chains hold type-like containers only, and they come from different instruments per
tier.** Namespaces are not segments: the file path already locates the file, a namespace spans
files and repos rather than nesting identity, and every fragment would pay its length. The
Roslyn sidecar walks ancestor type declarations. The tree-sitter binding deliberately gained no
node-navigation API — nesting is expressed in the query pattern itself (`@scope` captured beside
`@name` in one pattern), which keeps the binding capture-only and keeps the shape inside what
`ts_query_new` validates, so a wrong nesting shape refuses loudly at first use like every other
stale query (D47). The cost is honesty about depth: a fixed-shape query sees one level of
nesting, so tier 1 writes `Class/member` and never `Outer/Inner/member`; the sidecar walks
arbitrarily deep. Each language has exactly one deep tier, so the difference never produces two
addresses for one symbol.

**What the tiers emit is policy, and the filter is syntactic.** Tier 2 emits every type
declaration at any depth (v1 already emitted every top-level type regardless of visibility;
types are structure) and, as of the all-members spec (`docs/code-graph-all-members-spec.md`),
every member at every visibility — public, internal, protected, and bare private alike. The
original policy in this paragraph read a bare private member as implementation, not interface,
and excluded it; Jim overrode that directly ("private, public, protected, all members should be
indexed in the graph... the whole point is for the LLM to know your code") after
`engram_navigate defined_at` failed to find a `private static` method. The consumer is a model
reading the implementation, not a caller programming against a public API, so the visibility
line this paragraph used to draw no longer answers a question anyone was asking. Member kinds:
methods, constructors, properties, fields, events; nested delegates keep their kind. Tier 1
emits class methods (including getters, setters, abstract methods, and overload signatures) and
class fields **at every visibility**, interface method and property signatures, and top-level
function overload signatures; `#name` private members are captured through a second query
pattern per member kind (`(private_property_identifier)`, a distinct tree-sitter node type from
`(property_identifier)`, confirmed against the real pinned grammars) and the `private` keyword
line-prefix filter is gone. What is still excluded, in both tiers, is unchanged from the
original policy and rests on the same D44 measurement, not on visibility: enum members,
indexers, operators, local functions — each is a large population of low-recall-value facts, and
D44 already measured what a store full of near-noise does to lexical ranking. Method and
constructor declaration lines cut at the body (a `declared-as` fact carries a signature, not an
implementation); properties keep auto-accessor shapes (`{ get; set; }`) and drop computed
bodies.

**Sidecar protocol.** Symbol objects gain optional `"scope"` (pre-joined chain of the containing
types) and `"params"` (parameter list as written, raw). The parser tolerates their absence, so
output from an older sidecar still parses as v1-shaped symbols — robustness for skewed dev
environments, not a supported deployment; the pair ships together and the version bump forces
the re-read either way.

### D49 — `install.sh` acts by default, because a dry run is not what an installer was run for

Engram's rule is that anything destructive is dry-run first, and `install.sh` was on that list.
It should not have been. Every other verb there — `repair`, `compact`, `forget`, `backup prune`,
`backup restore`, `backup replay`, `queue compact`, `uninstall.sh` — **removes or rewrites
something that is already there**, and for those the flag is what stands between a user and a loss
they cannot undo. The installer only adds: a binary, a `PATH` block behind its own markers, a home
directory, and one file edit that is backed up first and refuses to overwrite a value Engram did
not write (D33). Running an installer is already the request to install, so the default now
installs and `--dry-run` is the brake.

**The cost being removed is real.** Requiring `--apply` made the first command anyone types do
nothing, which is a bad first contact for the one script that has to work before anything else can
be evaluated. The same argument as the install-everything default and D47's tree-sitter step: a
default that needs a flag to happen is not a default, and `fetch-vec0.sh` already demonstrated
where that ends — a step only the people who read the docs ever ran.

**`--apply` is parsed and ignored rather than removed.** About twenty end-to-end call sites, every
README written before this, and whatever is in a user's shell history all pass it. Erroring on it
would convert a silent no-op into a broken invocation for no gain, so the flag stays accepted with
its help text saying it is now the default.

**Two guards, and the no-flag one carries the rule.** `Install_WithNoFlagAtAll_Installs` asserts a
bare run puts the binary at the prefix; `Install_WithTheOldApplyFlag_StillInstalls` asserts the
compatibility path. Falsified by restoring `apply=false`: 14 of 17 tests in the round-trip file go
red, both new guards by their own messages. That breadth is itself the measurement — with the old
default and `--apply` inert, every `--apply` test does nothing, which is exactly the failure mode a
half-applied inversion would ship.

**Eight test sites depended on bare-means-dry-run** and were switched to `--dry-run`
(`InstallerSoupToNutsTests` ×2, `InstallerRoundTripTests` ×2, and the `Install(home)` helper call
in the embedding, tree-sitter, sqlite-vec, and plugin files). These are the tests that assert
*nothing happened*; left alone they would have gone on passing only until the assertion they
inverted mattered.

**The piped-run consequence was considered and accepted.** A run with no terminal now installs
everything Engram owns without asking, where before it printed a plan. That is the intent, and
`install.sh` is run from a checkout rather than curl-piped, since it needs the repo to build and to
register the marketplace. The one exception holds unchanged and matters more now: the MCP
permission grant edits `~/.claude/settings.json`, a file Engram does not own, and a run nobody is
watching still never grants it. Silence from a pipe is consent to install Engram; it is not consent
to edit somebody else's settings.

**Not ported to `install.ps1`.** The inversion's whole content is that a script acts without being
asked, and no one has run the PowerShell installer on a Windows machine even once — parse-gating
does not catch an inverted conditional, and the failure it would catch late is a "dry run" that
installs. It keeps `-Apply` and is tracked with the rest of the parity debt.

### D50 — the installer starts the server, and proves it is running before it says so

An install that ends with the server down looks finished and answers nothing. Nothing else starts
it: session start spawns maintenance, not the server, so the first session after a fresh install
finds memory unreachable until somebody types `engram start` — and the person most likely not to
know that is the one who just installed for the first time.

**The upgrade case is worse than the fresh one, and it is what makes this a defect rather than a
convenience.** Section 2 stops the daemon serving the binary about to be replaced, which it must:
`cp` over a running executable on macOS changes its pages underneath it. So before this step
existed, a reinstall *actively left the server down* — it stopped one and started nothing, and the
summary said the install succeeded. That is the same shape as D49's dry-run default: the script
did what it was told and not what it was for.

**Starting is not the claim; running is.** `start` health-checks before returning 0, but that is
the launching process vouching for itself. The step therefore asks again through `status`, a
separate process reading the pid file and start token and putting an HTTP health check — which by
D42 is a different question, and is the one every later consumer actually asks: a hook, a Claude
Code session, `doctor`. `StatusCommand` exits 0 only for `Running`, and that is what makes it
usable as a predicate at all.

**This is the one place where `Running` rather than `ServerIsAlive` is correct**, and the exception
should not be "fixed". D42's rule binds callers deciding whether they may *act alone*, where a
`Wedged` or `VersionMismatch` process is a live thing that can still race you. Here the question is
whether the server came up healthy, and both of those answers mean it did not.

**No polling loop, deliberately.** Given start's guarantee, a `status` that disagrees is news, not
a race to wait out. A retry window would convert a deterministic failure into an intermittent one
and would be fitted to hoped-for timing — the same argument that forbids a tolerance in D42's
identity comparison.

**Ordering is load bearing in both directions.** After section 8b, because a server holds the
embedder it built at its own startup (D38), so starting earlier would pin it to the setting the
user just moved away from. And last overall, with the tri-state `if` shape of 9/9b/9c, which
matters more here than anywhere else: this is the final step before the summary, so an abort under
`set -e` would take the whole report with it.

**Three guards, each falsified.** Default-starts, `--no-start`-leaves-it-stopped, and
dry-run-starts-nothing. Breaking the default to `false` reddens the first; making `--no-start` stop
pinning reddens the second. The load-bearing one is the third break — replacing `start` with a
command that succeeds without launching anything — because it is the only one that tests the
*validation* rather than the start: with it, the step still runs and the summary correctly says
`NOT running`. Two of the three falsifications silently no-opped on the first attempt, because the
`perl` patterns contained `$target` and `$with_start` and perl interpolated them to empty before
matching. Both reported green, which is exactly what a successful falsification also looks like;
the fix was to compare the file's checksum across the edit and refuse to trust an unchanged one.

**Every other installer test now passes `--no-start`.** Roughly thirty apply-mode call sites would
otherwise each launch a real daemon on the default port, fighting each other and whatever server
the developer running the suite already has up, and then have their sandbox home deleted from under
them. The three tests that do start a server take a private port through `ENGRAM_PORT`, which
needed `InstallerHarness.RunScriptWithEnvironment` because `install.sh` has no `--port` of its own
to forward, and they stop the server in a `finally` so a failed assertion cannot leak one.

**Not ported to `install.ps1`,** for D49's reason exactly: it is another step that acts unasked,
on a script nobody has run on Windows.

### D51 — Engram says where memory lives, because the system it competes with already does

Reported from a live session: asked to remember something, the model wrote to Claude Code's
file-based memory and only reached Engram as an afterthought. That was the correct reading of the
instructions it had, and the diagnosis matters more than the fix.

**The claim was missing, not merely weaker.** Claude Code's memory block is long, specific, and
fires on a literal trigger — *if the user explicitly asks you to remember something, save it
immediately.* Engram's answer, at the moment of "save this", was: `engram_remember`'s description,
which opened *"Save a durable note to this session's working memory"* — scratch space, on its face —
and named no trigger at all. Nothing anywhere told a top-level agent that Engram outranked anything.
The only place the write instruction existed was `PrimerBuilder.SubagentInstruction`, which reads as
extending a baseline to subagents; the baseline it extends was never stated. Two further causes were
found while checking: the standing guidance in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` said to search Engram *"if the
answer is not already in context or in the project's `memory/` directory"* — ranking the other store
first on reads too, in writing — and the `UserPromptSubmit` hook had **already captured** the
statement before the model acted, so the model's double-write produced three copies of one fact.

**The fix splits by whether something is a preference.** Rewriting `engram_remember`'s description
to open on durability and to name the trigger is not a preference — it corrects an under-specified
description, and it ships to everyone unconditionally. Declaring somebody else's memory system
subordinate *is* a preference: the files in it are the user's and Engram did not put them there. So
that half is `[memory] precedence` — `off | engram-first | engram-only`, defaulting to
**engram-first**, which corrects the ranking without silently disabling a system in use.

**The primer carries the configurable half because nothing else can.** Tool descriptions are
`[Description]` attributes — compile-time constants, identical for every install — so a per-user
setting cannot reach them. `SessionStart` matches `startup|resume|clear|compact`, so the primer is
re-injected at every point where context was reset, including after each compaction. That is the
honest limit of the approach and is recorded rather than hidden: between compactions the line is
ordinary context and decays, while the system prompt never does. `BuildForSubagent` repeats the line
rather than assuming the parent's, because `SessionStart` never fires for a subagent.

**Consequences that cost time and are not guessable.** The line goes **first**, because
`TryAppendLine` drops whatever overruns the budget and this is the only line whose absence changes
what the agent does. An empty store therefore no longer yields an empty primer — a fresh install
with nothing recorded is precisely the session where a competing system wins uncontested, so it is
the session that most needs telling; the empty case survives only under `off`, which `HookCommand`
still relies on. The D15 guard forbidding tool names in primer guidance had to gain **one** exemption,
subtracted by exact string rather than by pattern, and it was re-falsified afterwards to confirm it
still fails when generic guidance drifts back. `EmbeddingSetup.Apply` was extracted to `ConfigWriter`
rather than copied, since a second implementation of D33's conflict rule would diverge the first time
either was tuned.

**Measured.** The added config read is **below this machine's noise floor**: the shipped build alone
spans p50 14.33 / 15.43 / 16.97 / 15.79 ms across four runs of n=40, and a build with the read removed
measured 17.73 ms — inside that spread. No cost is claimed in either direction. `file-touched` is
untouched at p50 9.57 ms and never opens the config. The rewritten description initially blew
`McpToolSurfaceBudgetTests` — 3961 chars against a 3800 ceiling, `engram_remember` alone at 1013 when
the next largest tool is 405 — and was tightened to fit rather than the ceiling being raised; the final
wording is shorter than the one it replaced.

**Falsified.** Five unit breaks (no line; line emitted after the coverage line; line emitted when
configured off; subagent path dropping it; generic guidance drifting back) and three end-to-end breaks
(hook ignoring the config; shipped config losing the default; installer ignoring the flag), each
checksummed across the edit because a falsification that silently no-ops looks exactly like success.
The first attempt at one e2e break **did** no-op: commenting out `precedence = "engram-first"` left
`# precedence = "engram-first"`, which still satisfied the `Assert.Contains`. That exposed a real
weakness — the test had also been asserting on an installer summary line printed from a catch-all
branch that reads nothing, so it would have said `engram-first` whatever the config held. The
assertion now checks the config the install produced and then runs a hook against it.

**Not ported to `install.ps1`** (item 10 in the parity memo). The `--memory-precedence` flag and the
three-way prompt are both new interactive surface on a script nobody has run on Windows.

### D52 — a menu may not emit a row it cannot count

Reported: the model picker "keeps repeating the options", the text "is not formatted well", and it
"selected one I did not pick". One cause produces all three.

`Tui.Render` assumed **one choice occupies one terminal row**. Both escapes it relies on are
physical: `\x1b[{n}A` moves up n *rows*, and `\x1b[2K` clears *one* row. The model menu's entries
were built as `{dims} · {size} · {window} · {languages} — {tradeoff}`, and the tradeoff is a
paragraph, so an entry ran to about 290 characters. At 80 columns that is four rows against a
redraw of one. Every keypress therefore repainted three rows lower than the last (options
repeating), cleared one row in four (formatting debris), and left the visible `❯` on a stale copy
while the internal index moved on — so Enter selected what the user *wasn't* looking at. Measured
under a pty at 80 columns: entries of 290 characters, `\x1b[3A` between draws.

**The fix is to budget rows rather than hope for them.** Every line is clipped to the width — the
head (marker plus padded label) first, then the description against what is left, because a label
alone overflows a narrow terminal and clipping only the description leaves that unbounded. The
selected entry's prose moved to a new `TuiChoice.Detail`, rendered as a **fixed-height** block, so
the row count cannot vary with the selection. `Render` now *returns* the rows it wrote and the
caller feeds that back as the next redraw's distance, which makes the correspondence a value rather
than an assumption. One column is left unwritten because terminals disagree about whether writing
into the last cell wraps immediately or defers.

**Why the suite could not see it.** Every other test drives redirected streams and so takes
`Tui.Plain` by design. The one pty test presses Enter on the *first* menu, which selects `none` —
it never presses an arrow key, so no redraw ever ran, and it never reached the model menu whose
entries were the long ones. The bug was structurally unreachable. `Menu` blocks on
`Console.ReadKey`, which no test can feed, so an internal `Draw` seam was added and `Menu` routed
through it; `TuiRenderTests` then asserts the invariant deterministically at 24, 40, 80 and 200
columns, and the pty test gained a second case that reaches the model menu, redraws, and backs out
with `q` before anything downloads. The pty test deliberately does *not* assert on columns —
`script(1)`'s pty is whatever width it is, and an assertion needing a width it did not choose is
how a guard becomes flaky.

**Two things found by writing the tests, not before.** At 24 columns the label itself overflowed,
which the first fix missed because it clipped only the description. And the first version of the
catalog test **built its own choice list** instead of using the picker's, so it would have passed no
matter what `EmbeddingSetup` did — it could not see the defect it was written for. That is why
`EmbeddingSetup.ModelChoices` is now extracted and named: the test draws the same list the picker
draws. Clipping means concatenating the prose back in no longer corrupts the screen, it silently
ellipses the specs instead, so a second guard asserts the spec line survives un-ellipsed.

**Falsified six ways,** each checksummed: label unclipped, description unclipped, `Render` reporting
`choices.Count` instead of what it wrote, the detail block varying in height, the original defect
restored exactly (no clipping plus the concatenated description), and the prose concatenated back
into the spec line alone.

### D53 — a scan is bounded, and a partial scan may not be treated as an answer

**Decision.** `RepoScanner` takes a `ScanBudget` — a time allowance covering the whole scan, and a
file ceiling covering only the directory walk — and reports which one stopped it. Nothing that reads
a scan may treat a truncated one as complete: `CodeIndexer` skips deletions entirely, and `doctor`
warns instead of offering to index the directory.

**Why, measured.** `engram doctor` run from a home directory printed nothing, held 100% of a core
and **7.8 GB resident** at 106 seconds, and had to be killed — it never terminated on its own. A
stack sample showed it in `stat` and `opendir`: the `indexing` row calls `RepoScanner.Scan` on the
working directory, and outside a git checkout that falls through to `Walk`, which had no time
budget, no depth cap and no file ceiling, accumulating every path it saw.

Pruning was not the missing piece and adding patterns would not have fixed it. The walk already
prunes at the directory and skips embedded checkouts, but none of the configured globs — `bin`,
`obj`, `node_modules`, `.git` — describe `~/Library`, a package cache or a downloads folder. A plain
`find` counted **1,318,043** files under that home in 20 seconds and had not finished. The same
repository lists **289** files through `git ls-files` and **4,318** through an unpruned walk, so
roughly three hundred times separates the largest plausible target from the accident, and a ceiling
of 100,000 sits clear of both.

**The bound alone would have been a worse bug.** `CodeIndexer` computes deletions as *every
previously-indexed file absent from this scan*. Truncate the scan and every path past the cut is
absent for a reason that has nothing to do with the disk, so a slow scan would have become a
destructive one, retracting the code facts for most of a repository. By D8 those are derived state
and rebuildable, which is why this is a defect rather than a catastrophe — but a bound that silently
retracts thousands of facts is not a fix. Hence `ScanStop`, `Truncated`, and the rule that absence
is only evidence when the scan finished.

**Two bounds, not one spelling of the same one.** A tree of a million empty directories runs forever
under a file ceiling, because the collected list never grows — only the clock stops it. The ceiling
answers memory instead, and it is deliberately kept off the git path: a monorepo listing 150,000
files through `git ls-files` is completely enumerated, and calling it partial would disable its
deletions for good. Time still applies to a git listing, because classifying those files is Engram's
work rather than git's.

**Found by publishing the first fix and running the reported command.** Bounding only the walk left
doctor at **8.38 s** in that home directory: the walk stopped at its ceiling in about two seconds and
the classification pass then spent six more reading the head of each of 100,000 candidates to tell
source from binary from generated. The budget now covers both halves off one clock, and the check
sits on the first candidate rather than in a separate pre-check — two checks against one clock cannot
be told apart by a test, since whichever fires first answers for both and the other could be deleted
with the suite still green. After: **2.0 s and 258 MB**, against >106 s and 7.8 GB, with the row
saying the count is partial. Inside a real checkout it is unchanged at 0.00 s and 1 MB, because git
answers there and the walk never runs.

**Doctor warns rather than reporting `Off`,** and only in the truncated case. Left as it was, the row
answers a home directory with `-> engram index --apply`, an instruction to index the thing that just
could not be walked. `Warn` never sets exit 1, so D37's rule that only `Broken` fails is intact.

**Falsified nine ways,** each checksummed: the walk not checking the clock between directories, not
checking the ceiling, the summary not saying the count is partial, the ceiling applied after the fact
so git listings truncate too, classification unbounded again, a partial scan driving deletions again,
doctor offering to index what it could not walk, and — the other direction — each budget set tight
enough to fire on ordinary work, which must break the tests that say ordinary work is unaffected.
Without that last pair the bound could have been zero and everything still passed.

**Not measured:** the clock check inside the walk's per-directory entry loop, which exists for a
single directory holding millions of entries. Every deterministic test for it is shadowed by the
per-directory check against the same clock, and the timing-dependent version is the kind of guard
that gets deleted for flakiness rather than fixed. The ceiling test covers the same loop's structure;
the time branch through it is reasoned, not measured.

### D54 — the store answers how far, the server answers whether anything is moving

**Decision.** `engram embed --status` reports the vector index's progress. Counts come from the
database; liveness, rate, what is in flight, and the reason there is no loop come from
`embedding.json`, which the server writes and everything else only reads. `--watch` redraws through
`Tui.Frame` under D52's row budget, and the progress bar is a terminal decoration — a pipe gets
key-and-value lines.

**Why the split, rather than one source.** How many facts are embedded and how many are waiting is a
query any process can run, and it is right whether or not a server is up. What no reader can derive
is whether the loop is alive, how fast it is going, what it is working on, or why it never started:
those exist only inside the running loop, so the loop has to write them down. `MetalRecord` is the
same shape for the same reason (D42) — the process that knows records, the process that asks reads.
Counts are deliberately **not** in the file: duplicating them would create a second answer that goes
stale the moment the server stops, which is exactly the state someone is most likely to be reading it
in.

**The reason a number is not moving is the answer; the number is not.** Measured on a sandbox home
with 873 facts pending and a server up on port 8799: `--status` said `not running — start the server
with 'engram start'` — advice to do the thing that had already been done — while the server's log had
carried the real answer sixteen seconds earlier, `qwen3-embedding-0.6b is not downloaded yet`. The
only process that knows why there is no loop is the one that decided not to start it, and it was
writing that to a file nobody asking this question has cause to open. So `EmbeddingBacklogService`
records the reason as well as logging it, and status prints it in place of the generic advice. This
was found by running the feature against a real server, not by a test.

**A standing statement is not a heartbeat.** `Unavailable` is excluded from `LooksLive` outright.
Left in, a precise reason would have aged into `stalled or stopped` after forty-five seconds — a
worse message than the one it replaced, arrived at by a rule that was correct for the other case.

**The note may not outlive the server that wrote it,** and the loop's own cleanup cannot do it: when
the backlog declines, `RunAsync` is never entered. So the clear rides `ApplicationStopping` beside
the pid file's, with the same ownership test — an orphan being replaced must not delete the record
its replacement just wrote.

**The backlog was never silent.** It had logged `Embedded N fact(s); M pending.` since it was built,
and `builder.Logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Warning)` dropped every line, so a fifteen-minute
backfill left a log saying nothing about the only thing happening. The fix is one `AddFilter` entry,
not new logging code — worth stating because the obvious diagnosis, *the loop reports nothing*, was
wrong about the cause and would have produced a second logging path beside the one already there.

**Published per committed batch, not per pass.** A pass is up to eight batches of sixteen, and the
server log shows one measured at **28 seconds** — `Embedded 128 fact(s)` is a single line covering
02:14:46 to 02:15:15. Publish per pass and a watcher sees a frozen screen for half a minute at a time
and concludes nothing is happening. `sessionEmbedded` is counted in that callback only and never also
from `result.Embedded`, which would double it.

**Bounded and flattened at the point of recording.** The recent list keeps eight; bodies are cut to
160 characters and have their newlines replaced, because this is read back into a fixed-height
display and a body containing a newline costs a row the caller did not count — D52's defect, reached
through the data rather than the layout.

**No estimate from a rate nothing is producing.** `Eta` is null unless the backlog is live: a rate
measured by a process that has since stopped predicts nothing about a queue nobody is working on, and
an estimate is worse than none when it is confidently wrong. The rate is stated as a mean since the
run began, and says so, because a one-shot reader cannot sample twice without waiting and waiting is
what `--status` exists to avoid.

**No fraction without a denominator.** A bar reading 100% for a store with nothing in it looks like
success, so `Fraction` is null there and the line says `no store yet` instead.

**Measured working, end to end.** Sandbox home, 873 pending facts, `qwen3-embedding-0.6b` on Metal:
**4.5 facts/s**, eta `~3m 8s` at 3%, `last update 1s ago`, and eight in-flight bodies redrawn each
pass. The command answers in a few milliseconds because it never touches the model. After `stop` the
note is gone, the rate and eta are dashes, and the counts are still right — 208 of 873 — which is the
whole argument for keeping them in the store rather than the file.

**Falsified sixteen ways,** each break checksummed and each guard re-run against it: clipping removed
from `Frame`, the first frame moving the cursor, counts read from the note instead of the store, the
eta and the rate line each surviving a dead backlog, the bar drawn into a pipe, an empty store
reported complete, a drain publishing nothing, the recent list unbounded, a timestampless note
inventing a timestamp, the liveness window widened to a day, bodies keeping their newlines, an
unavailable note ageing into `stalled`, status dropping the recorded reason, the service logging
without recording, and a stopped server leaving its note behind. The last two republish the binary
first, because a tier-3 test run against the previous publish proves nothing.

**Not measured:** `--watch` over a long session on a terminal that is resized mid-run. `Frame`
inherits D52's assertions at four widths, but the width is read once per frame and a resize between
the move-up and the write is a row this cannot see — the same class of thing D52 left one column
unwritten for.

## PreCompact injects on bare stdout, and that is still not how `digest` gets called

The erratum this section used to carry — *no injection channel exists for `PreCompact`* —
was **wrong, and it was wrong in the way that is hardest to notice: it was read rather than
measured.** It cited the hooks reference, which lists `additionalContext` for `SessionStart`,
`UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolUse` and others and omits `PreCompact`, and concluded from the
omission. Measured 2026-08-09 by registering two `PreCompact` hooks against one real
compaction, each writing to a log *before* writing to stdout so "never fired" could be told
from "fired and discarded":

| channel | result |
|---|---|
| bare stdout | **delivered** — the marker arrived in the compaction request's *Additional Instructions*, and the summarizing model reproduced it on request |
| `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` | **rejected** — `Hook JSON output validation failed — (root): Invalid input` |

So the two channels are exactly inverted from `SessionStart`, where the envelope is required
and bare stdout is silently discarded. The reference is wrong about this hook family in *both*
directions, which makes the rule general: **measure the channel, never read it.** A probe costs
one compaction and settles it; a documentation citation settled it wrongly here for months.

Two caveats on that measurement, both real. Only the `manual` matcher was exercised — `auto`
was registered and no auto-compaction occurred, and auto is the case that matters more, since
it is the one nobody asked for. And the schema Claude Code prints on a validation failure is
**not exhaustive**: it omits `SessionStart`, which demonstrably works, so its contents are
evidence and not proof.

**The channel working does not make §10.1's goal reachable through it,** and this is the part
the original erratum got right for the wrong reason. `PreCompact` fires, the summarization runs,
the new context begins — there is no model turn in between. The model that reads this stdout is
the *summarizer*, which has no tools and whose only output is the summary. `PreCompact` therefore
cannot cause a tool call at all; the most it can do is plant an obligation that the *next* model
discharges, by which time the detail is gone. For `digest` that is backwards — its value is
capturing what was learned while the material still exists, and a digest written from a summary
is a digest of a digest.

> **Erratum, retracted and replaced (spec §10.1):** `PreCompact` *can* inject, on bare stdout.
> What it cannot do is cause a tool call, for a sequencing reason rather than a channel one. The
> lever that can is **`Stop`**, whose own schema entry reads *"Feedback for the model; the
> conversation continues so the model can act on it"* — turn end, full context, tools available.
> Engram registers no `Stop` hook and `HookCommand` has no `stop` verb, which is the mechanical
> reason M0's *"`digest` fires at session end without prompting"* has never been met. That gate
> is therefore **unmet, not unmeetable**, and it was retired in error.

The fallback this section installed — moving the nudge to the session primer and the recall
footer — is **measured and does not work.** The footer line `→ engram_remember what you discover
· engram_digest before session ends` rode 30 recalls across four days and produced 0 `digest`
events (and 0 `forget`, 1 `revise`). Standing guidance in a place the model already reads is not
a trigger; D51 says as much about memory precedence and it applies here unchanged. Anything built
on `Stop` needs a gate — it fires every turn, and a hook that nags on all of them is one the model
learns to skip (D37, applied to a hook) — and needs its telemetry to distinguish a prompted digest
from a chosen one, or it inflates the very number D18 and D43 read to answer whether the model
reaches for memory, in the direction that looks like success. That is the trap `user-prompt`
avoided by taking a kind of its own (D56).

## 1.5 Spike results (2026-08-04, measured)

Three day-1 spikes, all on macOS arm64 / .NET SDK 10.0.301 / Apple clang 21. Every
number below is measured, not estimated.

**Spike A — AOT startup.** Publish succeeded, zero trim/AOT warnings.

| | min | median | p95 | max | binary | publish dir |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Native AOT | 2.82 ms | **3.44 ms** | 4.34 ms | 4.55 ms | 1.06 MB | 6.6 MB |
| Self-contained, no AOT | 17.52 ms | 18.51 ms | 19.39 ms | 19.73 ms | 122 KB stub | 83 MB |

The hook budget is < 100 ms cold and < 10 ms for `file-touched`. AOT clears both with an
order of magnitude to spare; the non-AOT build would burn roughly twice the entire
`file-touched` budget doing nothing but starting. **D1's premise holds.**

The premise still holds; the spare does not. That table is a 1.06 MB binary with nothing
linked into it. The shipped binary is 21.2 MB with the MCP SDK and `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`
in it, and starts in 7.80 ms — 22% of headroom against the 10 ms budget, not an order of
magnitude. The number to carry forward is the current one; see the measurement under D4
rule 4. It is why binary size is now a latency decision.

**Spike B — MCP SDK under AOT.** `ModelContextProtocol` 2.0.0 with
`Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` 10.0.10. Publish succeeded with **zero IL2xxx/IL3xxx
warnings**, confirmed non-collapsed (`TrimmerSingleWarn=false`, and the generated
`ilc.rsp` suppresses only routine codes). `initialize`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call`
all round-trip from the published binary. Independently re-verified: `Mach-O 64-bit
executable arm64`, linking only system libraries with no .NET runtime in the output
directory, returning `pong: hi`. Binary 10 MB. **The hand-rolled JSON-RPC fallback is
not needed — use the SDK.**

**Spike C — SQLite and the D3 FTS5 schema under AOT.** `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` 10.0.10
with `SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_e_sqlite3` 3.0.5, bundled SQLite **3.53.4**. Publish
succeeded, zero warnings, binary 2.7 MB. All 11 assertions passed from the AOT binary —
including the three that actually mattered: closing a fact via `valid_to` evicts it from
the live lane (6), the `WHEN` guard stops a second close from double-deleting (8), and
`'integrity-check'` stays clean after both a close and a hard delete (9, 10). Porter
stemming, `bm25()`, and `snippet()` all work. **D3 ships as written.**

**Spike D — `sqlite-vec` under AOT (2026-08-05, measured).** Work-queue item B4, the one
gating spike for M4. `sqlite-vec` v0.1.9, the prebuilt `loadable-macos-aarch64` `vec0.dylib`
(162 KB, Mach-O arm64), against a spike binary that references the real `Engram.Core` and
mirrors `Engram.Cli`'s publish settings, so this is the shipped AOT configuration rather
than a friendlier one. Publish clean: zero IL2xxx/IL3xxx warnings, 2.78 MB Mach-O arm64.

**16 of 16 assertions pass from the AOT binary, and the same 16 pass under JIT.** The
extension loads, `vec_version()` answers, a `vec0` virtual table is creatable, vectors
insert, and KNN ranks nearest-first. FTS5 keeps working on the same connection, so the two
lanes D18 wants to fuse coexist. **D1's premise holds — but not by the mechanism D1 named**;
see the corrected bullet in D1.

The load is cheap and AOT does not tax it:

| | p50 |
|---|---|
| `Open` + pragmas (warm, in-process) | 0.288 ms |
| the same, plus `LoadExtension` | 0.459 ms |
| **extension load, AOT** | **+0.171 ms** |
| extension load, JIT | +0.219 ms |

Cold, which is what a hook-shaped process pays: process start 3.55 ms, opening the database
+1.04 ms, loading `vec0` on top of that **+0.33 ms**. Enabling embeddings therefore costs a
hook that already opens the database about a third of a millisecond, and costs `file-touched`
nothing, because it opens nothing.

Three findings worth more than the pass count:

1. **Extension state is connection-scoped, and pooling hides that.** A second
   `EngramDatabase.Open` in the same process still answered `vec_version()` — the pool
   returned the same `sqlite3` handle with the module registered. After `ClearAllPools`,
   which is what another process sees, it is gone. A vector query can pass in the long-lived
   MCP server and fail in a hook on pool luck alone. This is the pragma rule from D4 in a
   second costume, and it is now recorded next to it.
2. **A missing extension degrades, it does not corrupt.** From a connection with no
   extension loaded, a database containing a `vec0` table still reads ordinary tables,
   still writes under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, still answers the FTS5 lane, and passes
   `PRAGMA integrity_check` clean. Touching `fact_vec` fails loudly with
   `no such module: vec0`. The spec's promise that the system is fully functional with
   embeddings disabled survives a database that was *previously* embedded.
3. **A bad `lib/` path throws rather than killing the process.** Both an absent file and a
   non-Mach-O file raise a catchable `SqliteException`, and the connection keeps working
   afterwards. Graceful degradation can be implemented in a `catch`, not a preflight.

Two build notes for the real projects: the 10 MB MCP binary sits comfortably inside the
spec's 15–40 MB budget, and `.dSYM` bundles (39.8 MB for Spike B) must be kept out of
release artifacts.

**Spike E — LLamaSharp under Native AOT (2026-08-05, measured).** Work-queue item B5, the
one D25 demoted from gating to informative. LLamaSharp 0.27.0 with `LLamaSharp.Backend.Cpu`
0.27.0 against `Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf` (610 MB — the exact model D18 names, already
on the author's machine from the prior-art system D18 cites), in a spike project mirroring
`Engram.Cli`'s publish settings so this is the shipped configuration. Publishes with one
warning, 3.40 MB Mach-O arm64.

**13 of 13 checks pass from the AOT binary, and the same 13 pass under JIT.** Cosines agree
to three decimals between the two builds — one value differs by 1 in the fourth — so nothing
about AOT perturbs the arithmetic. The model loads, embeds at 1024 dimensions as
`[embedding] dim` claims, returns a bit-identical vector for a repeated string, and ranks
D18's own examples the way D18 predicts:

| query vs the fact that answers it | related | unrelated |
|---|---|---|
| *"what's my kid's name"* vs *"son is Liam"* | **0.5130** | 0.2373 |
| *"how do we avoid database lock errors"* vs *"every write is `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`"* | **0.4372** | 0.3845 |
| *"where does the home directory get resolved"* vs `EngramHome.Resolve(…)` | **0.6067** | 0.3774 |

FTS5 scores zero on all three: no token is shared between any query and its answer. That is
the capability D18 exists to buy, now demonstrated rather than argued — and the third row is
the mixed code-and-prose case D18 calls "not an edge case here, it is the corpus".

**So the ladder stops at rung 2.** D25's order of attack was localhost providers, then
in-process LLamaSharp, then an owned sidecar. In-process is AOT-clean, so it can be the
default and rung 3 is not needed.

Throughput, which is item 5b: **24.9 ms per embedding, 40/sec** single-threaded, and AOT is
*faster* here than JIT (29.8 ms). The 45-fact seeded corpus backfills in about a second and
ten thousand facts in four minutes — on a background queue, off the write path, so neither
is a latency figure.

**Model load is 6.4–6.6 s, which is the number D25 was reasoning about without one.** D25
argued the embedder must be long-lived rather than spawned per batch because loading the
weights per batch "would dominate everything". Measured: a batch of 24 embeddings costs
0.6 s against a 6.5 s load, so a per-batch process spends 91% of its life loading. It also
prices `idle_unload_minutes = 5` — a user who embeds once every six minutes pays the full
6.5 s each time, which is fine on a background queue and would not be fine on a query.

**The finding worth more than the pass count: a flat `~/.engram/lib/` does not work by
itself, and nothing in the filenames says why.** Every dylib the backend ships declares an
install name one version-suffix from what it is called on disk — `libggml.dylib` announces
itself as `@rpath/libggml.0.dylib` — and `libllama` asks for the suffixed name against an
rpath of `@loader_path`. Copy the seven libraries into one directory, point
`NativeLibraryConfig.LLama.WithLibrary` at `libllama.dylib`, and it fails: dlopen looks for
`libggml.0.dylib` beside it and finds only `libggml.dylib`.

What closes the gap is loading the ggml libraries first, by explicit path, in dependency
order — `NativeLibrary.Load`, which is what D1's bullet already prescribes for llama.cpp.
dyld registers an image under its own install name, so once `libggml.dylib` is in the
process it *is* what `@rpath/libggml.0.dylib` resolves to. LLamaSharp's own probing does
exactly this walk; `WithLibrary` skips it, because it documents that calling it makes "all
the other configurations ignored" — and the dependency walk is one of them.

Measured as a controlled pair: the same binary in the same otherwise-empty directory,
differing only in whether the library path was supplied. Without it,
`TypeInitializationException` → `RuntimeError: The native library cannot be correctly
loaded`. With it, 13 of 13. The control is the part that matters — it rules out the
treatment passing for some unrelated reason.

**The single AOT warning is this same defect seen from the compiler.** `IL3000`, on
`LLama.Native.NativeLibraryUtils.TryFindPath` reading `Assembly.Location`, which is the
empty string in a single-file or AOT app. Left to its own probing the binary only finds its
libraries when it happens to sit in its publish directory — D1's SQLite erratum wearing a
different name, except warned about at compile time rather than discovered in the field.
Engram sets the path explicitly regardless, so the warning is expected rather than
suppressed, and suppressing it would hide the next wrapper that makes the same mistake.

**Spike F — what SQL surface `vec0` actually exposes (2026-08-05, measured).** Not on the
original work queue; added because step 7's design turned out to rest on operations spike D
never exercised. Spike D proved a `vec0` table is creatable, insertable, and KNN-queryable —
enough to *read* the lane and not enough to build the backfill queue or `embed --rebuild`
around, since a virtual table is exactly the kind of thing that supports some of the obvious
operations and not others. 17 of 18 probes passed, and the one failure is the useful part.

**The backfill queue is a query, not a table.** Both `LEFT JOIN fact → fact_vec` and
`id NOT IN (SELECT fact_id FROM fact_vec)` work, as does a plain `SELECT fact_id FROM
fact_vec` scan and `COUNT(*)`. So "which live facts lack a vector" is answerable directly and
there is no queue table to keep in sync — which is the right shape under D8 regardless:
derived state that is recomputed from a join cannot drift from the thing it describes, and a
queue table can.

**`INSERT OR REPLACE` does not work.** It raises `UNIQUE constraint failed on fact_vec
primary key` rather than replacing. This is the one that would have been discovered late,
because it is the idiom a C# author reaches for by reflex and it fails only on the
second write for a given fact. Re-embedding is `UPDATE fact_vec SET embedding = ?`, which
does work in place, or delete-then-insert. `DELETE FROM fact_vec` with no predicate clears
the table and `DROP TABLE` removes it, so both flavours of `--rebuild` — same width, and a
width change that invalidates the table itself — have a path.

**`vec0` is transactional.** An insert inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` survives commit and a
rolled-back insert leaves nothing behind. So a vector write can ride the same transaction as
the fact it describes. D18 still puts embedding on a background queue off the write path, and
this does not reopen that — it means the *backfill* writer needs no special handling to stay
consistent with D4.

**A wrong-width vector is rejected, and says so precisely**: *"Expected 8 dimensions but
received 16."* That is worth knowing because it bounds what the dimension pin in `schema_meta`
is actually for. Width is self-defending at the row level; **the model is not**. Two models of
the same width will both insert happily and rank meaninglessly against each other, which is
D18's silent-degradation case. So `schema_meta` must record the model identifier, not merely
the dimension, and the dimension pin is the cheap half of a check whose expensive half has no
other source.

`distance_metric=cosine` is accepted on the `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE`, so the metric the ranking
assumes is declared rather than defaulted — `vec0` defaults to L2.

One flaw in the spike itself, recorded so the result is not read as stronger than it is: the
KNN probe used vectors differing only by a small per-component offset, so every cosine
distance collapsed to ~0 and the ordering it "confirmed" was degenerate. Spike D established
KNN ordering with properly separated vectors; this run adds nothing on that point and should
not be cited for it.

**Spike G — what loading `sqlite-vec` costs per connection (2026-08-05, measured).** Spike D
established that extensions are connection-scoped and that pooling hides it, and turned that
into a prohibition: never infer loadedness from a successful query. It did not say *where* the
load goes, and the two candidate answers differ in kind. An opt-in loader — the vector lane
asks for the extension on the connections it uses — keeps the cost off every other path, at
the price of a defect class that is invisible exactly where it would be caught: a caller who
forgets still passes, because some earlier connection loaded the module and the pool recycled
its handle, and the failure surfaces only in a process that draws a cold one. An unconditional
loader in `EngramDatabase.Open` removes that class outright and charges every open for it.
Which is right is a question about a number, so the number was measured rather than argued.

**0.195 ms on a cold connection, 0.036 ms on a pooled one**, over 200 opens each. The database
open it rides along with is 1.0–1.5 ms, so the eager load is under a fifth of a cost the caller
is already paying, and comfortably inside the margin the primer hooks run in. `file-touched` is
untouched by this because it never opens the database at all. **So the loader is unconditional**,
in `Open`, and no caller can forget it.

Two supporting facts make that shape possible. **Loading the extension twice on one connection
is a no-op, not an error** — which is what lets `Open` load eagerly without breaking a caller
who loads again to learn the resulting state, since the state is a return value and cannot be
looked up. And **a failed load leaves the connection fully usable**: the `SqliteException` is
catchable and `SELECT 1` still answers afterwards, so an unreadable extension costs the vector
lane and nothing else, and recall degrades to FTS5 instead of failing. That is what justifies
`Load` never throwing, and what separates the three states it reports — an absent `lib/` is the
ordinary condition of an instance that never opted into embeddings, while a file that is present
and will not load is a fault `doctor` has to name differently.

One check failed, and the failure is the useful part: **`LoadExtension` succeeds without
`EnableExtensions(true)`**. The provider enables loading around the call itself, so the
`EnableExtensions` line every sqlite-vec example carries is cargo here. It is omitted, having
been shown unnecessary rather than assumed so.

Spike D's pooling finding was re-checked in the same run and still holds, and it is now pinned
by a test rather than a memory — `AConnectionThatLoadedNothing_StillInheritsTheExtensionFromThePool`
fails loudly if the provider ever stops recycling handles, which would make the whole argument
above obsolete rather than merely wrong.

**Spike H — a KNN filter must live inside the MATCH, not after it (2026-08-05, measured).**
Step 7's obvious design is to run KNN over `fact_vec` and then join `fact` and drop anything
with `valid_to` set. That design is wrong, and it fails in the worst available shape: silently,
and worse as the instance ages.

`vec0` applies `k` before the join. So the k nearest *vectors* are chosen with no regard to
liveness, and the join then deletes some of them. Measured on ten facts whose four nearest to
the query are closed: **a post-filter join asking for 5 live facts returns 1.** No error, no
warning, just a short answer. Because facts are append-only and superseded rows accumulate
forever, the proportion of dead vectors only grows — recall that works on a young instance
quietly starves on an old one, which is precisely the degradation this project keeps writing
guards against.

**The fix is a metadata column in the `vec0` table, filtered in the same statement as the
MATCH.** The same query with `AND v.is_live = 1` returns a full five. Inequalities work too.
Both retirement paths are available and both were exercised: **`UPDATE fact_vec SET is_live = 0`
works in place** — so supersession can retire a vector without deleting it — and `DELETE` works,
which keeps the index proportional to live facts rather than to every fact ever written. D8
permits either, a vector being derived state; the choice belongs to step 7 and is not settled
here.

**Settled in step 7: retire by update, and reconcile rather than maintain.** `UPDATE`, because
a superseded fact is still answerable — `recall --as-of` and `history` both ask for beliefs that
are no longer current, and a lane that has thrown its vectors away cannot serve them. The index
therefore grows with every supersession, which is `compact`'s problem: pruning retired vectors
is exactly the derived-state pruning D8 permits, and the cost of getting one back is one
embedding.

More consequential is *when* the update runs, and the obvious answer is also wrong. Retiring the
vector inside `FactStore`'s supersession would put a `vec0` statement on the write path, so an
instance whose `lib/` went missing — the extension is side-loaded and optional by construction
(D1, D18) — would have a `fact_vec` table it can no longer address, and every `remember` would
fail with `no such module: vec0`. Authored truth would then depend on an optional accelerator.
Catching and ignoring that error is worse than failing: it leaves the index silently stale with
nothing recording that it is. So liveness is **reconciled at the head of each backfill pass**
instead of maintained at write time. Staleness is bounded by the pass interval and bounded in
the safe direction — a stale row means a superseded fact can still be returned, never that a
live one is hidden. The same pass drops vectors whose fact is gone entirely, which is what
`compact` pruning a fact leaves behind.

`PARTITION KEY` is also accepted and a partitioned KNN returns the right rows, which is the
mechanism to reach for if scope ever needs to bound the search rather than merely filter it.

Two flaws in the spike, recorded so the result is not read as stronger than it is. **The first
run was worthless and looked fine**: the insert loop never called `ExecuteNonQuery`, so every
probe queried an empty table, and the headline check — "post-filtering loses results" — passed
vacuously on a count of zero. It now asserts the row count after insert, and the check requires
`> 0 and < 5` rather than merely `< 5`, so an empty table fails instead of confirming. Second,
the `IN (...)` probe used `IN (0, 1)` on a column whose only values are 0 and 1, so the set
covered everything and the probe shows only that the syntax is *accepted* — it does not show
that `IN` filters correctly, and must not be cited for that.

### 1.6 Constraints the in-process embedder has to satisfy

These are requirements with stated reasons, **not measurements** — none has been verified here,
and each is written so it can be falsified when `LLamaSharpEmbedder` is built. They are recorded
now because every one of them is cheap to satisfy up front and expensive to retrofit, and
because several fail silently rather than loudly.

**Native logging has to be redirected before the first model load.** llama.cpp writes progress
and warnings to the process's standard streams. Engram's MCP server speaks JSON-RPC over stdio
and its hooks emit JSON on stdout, so unsuppressed native logging does not merely add noise —
it corrupts the protocol frame and takes the whole integration down in a way that looks like a
client bug. The log callback must be installed before any weights load, and must forward errors
somewhere useful rather than discarding them.

**Each sequence's KV cache must be cleared after its embedding is read.** Batched embedding
packs N texts into one decode as N sequences; if the per-sequence cache is not released after
reading, the next batch inherits state from the last. The result is not a crash but *plausible
wrong vectors* — they have the right shape, the right norm, and rank badly. Nothing downstream
can detect this, which is why it belongs in the first version rather than a later fix.

**A batch failure must degrade to per-text retries, and a text that still fails must produce no
row at all.** The tempting representation for "this one failed" is an empty or zero vector, and
it is a trap: a zero vector makes cosine similarity NaN, which surfaces later, elsewhere, as a
ranking that is neither right nor obviously wrong — the same hazard `StubEmbedder` already
guards against for empty input. Leaving the fact unembedded is strictly better, because the
backfill query is `LEFT JOIN … WHERE v.fact_id IS NULL`: a fact with no vector is already the
representation of "needs embedding", so a failure retries itself on the next pass with no
bookkeeping. **This obliges `IEmbedder.EmbedAsync` to express per-item failure**, which the
current signature cannot — it returns `IReadOnlyList<float[]>`, so the only failure it can
express is "the whole batch threw", and one poison text would then block its whole batch
permanently. The return type has to admit a null per element.

**The embedder must serialize its own callers.** One context is not concurrency-safe, and the
MCP server is concurrent by construction. Serializing inside the embedder rather than at each
call site is what keeps that from being a rule every future caller has to remember.

**Model identity and dimension must both be pinned, and a mismatch must degrade rather than
refuse.** Spike F established why the model and not just the width: two models of equal width
insert happily and rank meaninglessly. The response to a mismatch is a separate question, and
for Engram it is *not* to refuse to open the database — recall works without the vector lane,
and a memory system that will not start because an optional accelerator changed is worse than
one that answers on FTS5 and says so. `doctor` names it; `embed --rebuild` fixes it.

**External-content FTS5 deletes must run while the row they mirror still exists.** D3's FTS5
index is external-content, so its delete reads the content table to find what to unindex.
Deleting the content row first leaves the index holding a phantom. This orders every deletion
path — `forget`, compaction, and any re-embed that replaces a row.

**The compute backend is chosen per host, and the wrong one fails as slowness rather than as
an error.** Metal on macOS, CUDA on Linux and Windows where a driver is present, CPU
otherwise (D28). A CPU fallback on a machine with a usable GPU is not a crash and not a
warning — it is the same silent half-speed failure the Apple SDK field produces, arriving by a
different route. So whatever selects the backend must also *report* what it selected, and
`doctor` must show it. Note that spike E's loading order — `NativeLibrary.Load` each
dependency by path before handing the main library to LLamaSharp — was derived from macOS
install-name behaviour and has no verified Windows or Linux equivalent.

**Fetching a native library is a supply-chain decision, not a download.** `init
--with-embeddings` has to pull `sqlite-vec` for the host platform, pin an exact
version — the extension version and the schema it writes are coupled — and cache it in
`lib/`. The obvious implementation fetches a release archive over HTTPS and extracts it, and
the obvious implementation is not sufficient here: Engram would be downloading a native library
and loading it into its own process, so the archive's **checksum must be pinned and verified
before the file is written**, and a mismatch must abort rather than warn. An unavailable
download degrades to embeddings-off with a message naming the manual path, per the three states
`VectorExtensionState` already distinguishes. The uninstaller removes `lib/` with everything
else it created.

This paragraph named llama.cpp alongside `sqlite-vec` until D45, and the code never did either
thing with it — first finding a `llama-server` on PATH, then linking the library at build time. Both
are now true statements about one artifact: `sqlite-vec` is fetched and pinned; llama.cpp arrives as
a NuGet backend package resolved for the target RID, which is the same supply-chain question
answered by the restore rather than by Engram.

## 2. Riskiest assumption, and how it gets tested first

> **A ≤ 300-token session primer will make Claude Code call `engram_recall` before
> exploring files — unprompted, session after session.**

Everything else in the spec is well-motivated engineering that only pays off if this
holds. It is testable in days for almost no cost: a stub MCP server with ~30 canned
facts plus the SessionStart primer hook answers it without a real store. If the agent
will not reach for recall when perfect canned answers are waiting, no schema fixes it;
if it will, the rest of the build is justified.

**M0.0 is therefore the stub probe** (§3), and it runs before the real store is
written.

Secondary risks, in order:
1. ~~AOT publish breaks on a dependency~~ — **retired by Spike A/B/C** (§1.5). The CI
   AOT smoke test still runs on every push to keep it retired.
2. ~~The MCP C# SDK is not AOT-friendly~~ — **retired by Spike B** (§1.5): zero trim
   warnings, full stdio round-trip from the published binary.
3. Agent-written fact quality is poor enough that recall output is noise (visible in
   M0 telemetry; the response is tool-description and primer wording, not code).
4. Roslyn under AOT — *untested*, and the reason D1 puts it in a sidecar. It is only
   reached in M3, and the sidecar means a negative result costs nothing.

---

## 3. Milestones (revised)

### M0 — Adoption probe · ~1 week + 2 weeks of real use

**M0.0 (days):** the home resolver and sandbox installer flags (D7) — these come first
because every later line of code depends on them and retrofitting is expensive — then a
stub MCP server, ~30 hand-written canned facts, SessionStart primer hook, PreCompact
digest nudge. No database. Purpose: answer §2's question.

**M0.1 (rest of week):** minimal real store behind the same tool surface — `entity`,
`fact`, `supersession`, `session`, live-only FTS5, D4's four concurrency rules. Three
MCP tools only: `engram_recall`, `engram_remember`, `engram_digest`. Two hooks:
`SessionStart`, `PreCompact`.

**Telemetry (the actual deliverable):** per session — recall calls, remember calls,
coverage distribution (high/partial/none), tokens returned vs. budget, and whether
recall preceded first file read.

**Exit criterion:** two weeks of real self-use showing the agent calls `recall` before
exploring in a clear majority of sessions, and `digest` fires at session end without
prompting. If it does not, stop and fix adoption — not the schema.

Explicitly deferred out of M0: `browse`, `expand`, `revise`, `forget`, `share`/`join`,
salience, the CLI surface, embeddings, any code indexing.

### M1 — Core store hardened

Full §4.1 schema including `edge`, `salience`, `file_state`, `schema_meta`. Salience
scoring (§4.4). `MoveSubtree` cascade (D2). Remaining MCP tools: `browse`, `expand`,
`revise`, `forget`, `status`. Full CLI (§11) minus indexing/embedding verbs.
`doctor` **and `repair`** (D8), `export`/`import`. Migration framework keyed on
`schema_meta.schema_version`.

**Exit:** the spec's own criterion — remember → recall → revise → history shows a
reasoned chain — plus the D4 concurrency test (hook p99 under concurrent bulk write)
passing, and a corruption drill: deliberately damage the FTS index and a salience table
in a sandbox home, confirm `doctor` names both and `repair --apply` fixes them with
every fact body and supersession row bit-identical afterwards.

### M2 — Claude Code integration complete

Full hook suite, `engram install claude-code` with **safe idempotent JSON merge** into
`~/.claude/settings.json` and `.mcp.json` (back up first, `--dry-run` prints the diff,
uninstall is symmetric — this must never clobber a user's config), `share`/`join`,
session lifecycle, `report` HTML.

**Exit:** fresh machine, `engram init && engram install claude-code`, agent uses memory
unprompted in a real session.

### M3 — Code graph

Path-grammar document (versioned) first. Then universal + document analyzers with
extractive impressions, incremental pipeline over `file_state`, `engram_code`,
stale-subject flagging, adopt/merge for deep-tier re-keys (D2). Roslyn sidecar last.

Tiering, language priority, and the registry that makes new languages cost one row are
**D24**: C# first, TypeScript/JavaScript second. All code facts are written `observed`
(D19) and `regenerable` (D23), which is what makes a full re-index safe.

**Gate:** M0/M1 telemetry should show that missed recalls are substantially
code-structure questions. If they are not, M3 shrinks or moves behind M4. If they *are*,
it is built here: per **D20**, Engram does not outsource this to Graphify or any other
external server, because an MCP dependency is still a dependency.

**Gate status: unread, not failed.** Going to check it turned up 7 recalls total on the instance
that has been running this repo, none of them code-structure questions, and 390 primer records
carrying nothing about memory at all — so the population the gate asks about barely exists and the
larger delivery path was not recorded. D46 fixes the recording. Until enough accumulates, "the gate
is not met" and "the gate cannot be evaluated" are different statements and only the second is true.
Reading 7 events as evidence *against* code-structure questions would be the same mistake as reading
28.6% `coverage: none` as a paraphrase-miss rate (D44).

### M4 — Embeddings

`IEmbedder` providers, `sqlite-vec` lane, RRF fusion, batch/backfill,
`embed --rebuild`. Reconsider D5 here with vector evidence. **D18** carries the rationale,
the lexical/semantic split, and the constraint that this never becomes a vector service.

### M5 — Polish

Salience tuning, `compact`, report completeness, doctor on aged installs.

Cross-cutting engineering rules, decided now because retrofitting them is expensive:

- **`IClock` everywhere.** Every table is temporal; tests need a fixed clock or
  supersession semantics cannot be asserted deterministically. No `DateTimeOffset.Now`
  outside the clock.
- **`ITokenCounter`** behind an interface. Ship a calibrated character-ratio estimator
  first — the `214/500 tokens` line only needs to be honest, not exact — and leave the
  seam for a real BPE tokenizer if budgets ever prove sloppy.
- **The §6.2 recall output format is a contract.** Golden-file tests, changed
  deliberately.
- **AOT publish runs in CI from day 1**, on every push. A trim break found in M3 is
  expensive; found in M0 it is a package swap.
- **No `EF Core`, no ORM.** Hand-written SQL against `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`. It keeps
  the AOT surface small and the query plans visible, which is the whole point of the
  prefix-range-scan design.
- **One home resolver, no exceptions** (D7). Paths come from it or they are a bug, and
  a lint test enforces that. Every test runs against a disposable home.
- **Every destructive operation is dry-run first.** `repair`, `compact`, `forget`, and
  the installer all print what they would do and require an explicit flag to act.

## 5. Execution model

Implementation is delegated to **Sonnet** subagents; I write the spec for each work
item, review every diff myself, and dispatch test/build runs to the Haiku runner so
their output does not crowd out review.

Per work item:

1. I write a precise, decision-free spec (files, contracts, test assertions).
2. A Sonnet implementor builds exactly that and reports what changed.
3. I read the diff. Separately, the runner executes the build + tests and returns only
   failures and the exit code.
4. Anything ambiguous comes back to me as a decision, never guessed at downstream.

Verification I will not accept on report alone: temporal correctness (supersession
chains and `valid_to` closure), the D4 concurrency rules, the D7 isolation guarantees,
`repair`'s promise never to touch authored facts, and anything touching
`~/.claude/settings.json`.

---

## 6. Immediate next steps

1. ~~`git init` and first commit~~ — **done**, pushed to a private `JimCline/engram`
   (since renamed `JimCline/claude-engram`; GitHub redirects the old URL).
2. ~~Day-1 spikes~~ — **done**, all three green (§1.5). D1 and D3 confirmed by
   measurement; the MCP SDK is used directly, no fallback needed.
3. Scaffold the solution: `Directory.Build.props` (net10.0, nullable, warnings as
   errors), the projects from §4, and CI running build + tests + an AOT publish smoke
   test on every push.
4. Build **M0.0** — home resolver and sandbox install flags first (D7), then the stub
   adoption probe — and start using it in real sessions.

### 6.1 Work queue for D15–D18 (captured 2026-08-05, not yet started)

Ordered by risk retired per unit of work, not by decision number. Nothing below has been
implemented; D15–D18 are written but unbuilt.

**A. Tool-surface work — small, independent, no spike needed**

1. ~~**D15** — move the durable guidance out of `PrimerBuilder`~~ — **done** (`1b97491`).
   It required no addition to the tool descriptions at all: the primer's instruction was
   already stated nearly phrase for phrase across `engram_recall`, `engram_remember`, and
   `engram_digest`, so the fix was deleting the duplicate from the channel that does not
   survive compaction. `SubagentInstruction` deliberately stays in the hook — durable but
   not *universal*, and a tool description is shared with a main agent that does not need
   telling its report is lossy. `HookCommand` now declines to emit an empty primer.
2. ~~**D17** — ceiling on the tool surface~~ — **done** (`1b97491`), measured at **2,399
   characters** across four tools, ceiling set to 2,600. Lives in
   `tests/Engram.Integration.Tests/` rather than tier 1, because only that project
   references `Engram.Cli`. Falsified before being kept: at a ceiling of 2,000 it fails
   with the per-tool breakdown. A sibling test pins the tool count at four.
3. Golden-file both tool descriptions under the D9 recall-contract treatment. They are a
   model-facing interface now, not prose. **Still outstanding** — the D17 ceiling catches
   size drift but says nothing about wording, which is the part the model actually reads.

**B. Spikes that gate M4 — these carry the real risk**

*Substantially retired by prior art.* A separate project of the author's already runs
Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B in-process via LLamaSharp into a `sqlite-vec` store, with LM Studio and
Ollama as alternative providers. Model selection, the nomic comparison, and "does this
combination work at all" are answered — do not re-run them. **What remains is Native AOT,
which that project does not evidence**, and it is now the whole of this group.

4. ~~**Does `sqlite-vec` load under Native AOT?**~~ **Answered — yes.** Spike D in §1.5:
   16/16 from the AOT binary, identical under JIT, +0.17 ms warm and +0.33 ms cold. Not
   through `NativeLibrary.Load`, which is the wrong mechanism for a SQLite loadable
   extension; D1's bullet is corrected. **This group no longer gates M4.** What it leaves
   behind for M4 to honour: the extension is per-connection and pooling disguises that, and
   a database holding a `vec0` table stays fully usable from a connection that cannot load
   it.
5. ~~**Does LLamaSharp work under Native AOT?**~~ **Answered — yes.** Spike E in §1.5: 13 of
   13 checks from the AOT binary, the same 13 under JIT, one `IL3000` warning that is real
   and must be answered by configuration rather than suppressed. **The ladder stops at rung
   2** — in-process is the default and the owned sidecar is not needed. What it leaves behind
   for M4 to honour: the ggml libraries must be `NativeLibrary.Load`-ed by explicit path in
   dependency order before `WithLibrary`, because their install names carry a version suffix
   their filenames do not.
5b. ~~Only if both pass: confirm embedding throughput…~~ **Answered.** 24.9 ms per embedding,
    40/sec, AOT faster than JIT. The seeded corpus backfills in about a second. Model load is
    6.5 s and paid once per process, which is what makes the embedder long-lived rather than
    per-batch.

**C. M4 proper, in dependency order (only after B is green)**

6. `IEmbedder`, and a **deterministic stub embedder first** — tier-2 tests need it to
   exist before anything real does, per D18's ordering caveat.
7. Vector table + backfill queue. Embedding runs server-side, off the hook path (D4).
8. ~~**`engram explain <query>` first (D21)**~~ — shipped, and it found the ranker blind to
   morphology before fusion was written (D30). Then RRF fusion (`k≈60`) in retrieval, with
   FTS5-only as a fully supported configuration when the lane is absent — degraded
   quality, never a missing result. The order within this step is the decision: an
   explainer written after the fusion it explains is written against remembered
   intentions rather than observed behaviour. **Fusion now has a prerequisite of its own:**
   the lexical lane has to actually reach recall. Today `RecallEngine` ranks by literal term
   overlap and never queries `fact_fts`, so "fuse BM25 with vectors" is two changes, and the
   first is worth landing and measuring alone.
9. `embed --rebuild`; `doctor` and `repair` coverage for the vector index as derived
   state (D8).

**D. Cheap, unblocked, do whenever**

10. ~~**D16's gate** — measure the real facts-per-session distribution on the author's
    instance.~~ — **done.** Median **1** against a gate of 5 (`[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 8, 20]`
    across 7 fact-writing sessions), so D16 lapses and the expand view is not built. The
    measurement lives in `engram probe` rather than in a one-off script, because a gate
    whose evidence cannot be re-taken is a gate that quietly stops being true.
11. ~~§1's intro still says *"Six architectural forks were adjudicated with Fable"*~~ —
    done. The count reflects the decisions actually present, and the Fable provenance
    stays scoped to six rather than being extended to decisions whose origin is not mine
    to assert. That was the only thing blocking the fix; the two claims did not have to
    travel together.

**E. Provenance tier (D19) — independent of A–D; run it alongside A**

12. Schema migration adding a **nullable** provenance column to `fact`; existing rows stay
    `NULL` (*unknown, predates the tier*). No backfill by inference — see D19.
13. Write path: `engram_remember` and the capture hook set the tier at insert. User
    captures are `stated`; anything carrying `evidence` is `observed`; otherwise
    `inferred`. Assert in tier 2 that the column is never updated after insert, and that
    `repair` cannot touch it.
14. Recall output: render the tier as a one-or-two-token marker with `NULL` shown
    distinctly from `inferred`. This is a golden-file change under D9 and counts against
    the D17 ceiling.

15. **`engram report` (D22)** — read-only Markdown enumeration of everything stored,
    including superseded facts, with no truncation and no HTML. Build it *with* E, not
    after: it is the fastest way to check whether the D19 tiers were assigned sensibly.

16. **`regenerable` marker (D23)** — same migration as step 12, separate column, immutable
    at insert. Rework `repair` to key off it alone and never off provenance, with the
    falsification test that flips an agent observation to `regenerable` and confirms
    `repair` would consume it.

*Deliberately not in scope for E:* letting provenance influence retrieval ranking, and any
numeric confidence score. Both are rejected in D19. No visualization or dashboard, per D22.

**F. Language analyzers (D24) — gated behind M3, listed so the shape is not re-litigated**

17. Language registry as a static compile-time table (AOT cannot discover implementations),
    plus a conformance suite that iterates it and a lint test asserting no harness carries
    its own language list.
18. Tier 1 `tree-sitter` loader via `NativeLibrary.Load` from `~/.engram/lib/`, following
    the `sqlite-vec` pattern. C# and TypeScript/JavaScript grammars, in that order.
19. Tier 2 Roslyn sidecar for C# only. TypeScript does **not** get a tier-2 analyzer — that
    would mean a Node runtime, which D20 rejects in principle.

**Standing tension to re-read before starting C.** D18 gates M4 behind M0/M1 telemetry
showing paraphrase misses, and the seeded corpus is 45 facts. The owner has
said they want semantic search regardless; B is pure risk-retirement and worth doing
either way, but C's payoff scales with corpus size and with the gap in time between the
session that wrote a fact and the one that queries it.

## D55 — The webhook delivers the telemetry log, starting at its end

**Question.** Something outside Engram wants to react to memory activity as it happens — a script
that renders Claude Code's status line, and later a dashboard showing live and long-term use. What
emits, what does it emit, and what happens when the subscriber is not there?

**Decision.** `[webhook] url` (or `urls`) configures subscribers. `WebhookService`, a hosted service
in the server, tails `telemetry.jsonl` and POSTs each new record. The body is the log line verbatim,
one event per request, with `X-Engram-Event` and `X-Engram-Version` headers so a shell script can
route without a JSON parser. The tail starts at end-of-file and never resumes. A failed delivery is
dropped, the subscriber is muted with a doubling backoff to 30 s, and each subscriber gets at most
one failing attempt per poll.

**Why the log rather than a new event bus.** Every kind Engram records is already appended to
`telemetry.jsonl` by hooks and by the server alike. Tailing it is the only design in which the live
feed and a reader of history are the same data — a fast path for MCP events would be where the two
views begin to drift. It also means emission stays free: `file-touched` holds a 10 ms budget and is
forbidden from opening the database (D4), and an outbound POST costs far more than the open it may
not do. Only the long-lived server can afford to deliver, and it is the only thing that does.

**Why no cursor.** A resume point makes a restart after downtime replay thousands of `file-touched`
events describing edits from days ago, at a status line that renders "now". Starting at the end
gives a contract in one sentence — *this is what happened while the server was running* — with no
staleness threshold to tune. Nothing is lost: the log is durable, plain text and timestamped, so
history is a read of the file, which is what a dashboard should be doing for anything beyond the
tail. That same durability is what makes dropping a failed delivery safe rather than lossy.

**Why one failing attempt per subscriber per poll.** A subscriber that refuses fails instantly; one
that accepts and hangs costs the full timeout. Without the bound, 64 records against a 2 s timeout
is a two-minute poll in which nothing is delivered to anyone. Muting is per URL for the same reason
a status line must not go dark because an unrelated dashboard was closed.

**Rejected: an envelope around the record.** `{"schema":1,"event":{…}}` adds a nesting level every
subscriber unwraps for no information, and makes the live feed parse differently from the file —
the one property this feed exists to have.

**Rejected: an `enabled` key.** A configured URL is the switch. Two ways to turn one thing off is
how a setting ends up disagreeing with itself.

**Measured, and none of it guessable.** (1) A reader can starve `DurableAppend`: its writer opens
`FileShare.None`, which an open reader refuses, and after the 500 ms budget it *returns* rather than
throwing, so the record vanishes with no error. Relaxing the writer to `FileShare.Read` admits
readers but was measured to let two appenders both succeed, destroying the cross-process
lost-update protection `None` exists for — so the reader cannot be made harmless from the writer's
side. The tail holds the file for microseconds twice a second against a 500 ms retry budget, so
collisions retry rather than drop; a second reader would need this revisited. (2) The obvious test
for `TelemetryEventKind.All` walks `All` and asserts each entry is accepted, which is a tautology:
deleting a kind means it is never visited, and that version passed with the defect in place. The
guard reads the constants by reflection instead. (3) `StartAsync` promises only that `ExecuteAsync`
was scheduled, so a test writing events immediately after it can beat the tail to its starting mark
— that failed under load, passed in isolation, and looked exactly like a broken feature. The
startup log line is emitted after the mark is taken, so waiting for it is the barrier.

**Diagnosis.** No subscriber is `Off`, not a fault. A malformed URL is `Broken`, matching a bad
embedding endpoint: nothing degrades, delivery simply does not happen, and someone is waiting at
the other end. A `kinds` entry Engram never emits is only `Warn` and lands in
`WebhookSettings.Unknown` rather than `Problems` — `Problems` clears `IsEnabled`, so folding it in
would stop delivering the kinds that were spelled correctly, the same trap a retired key set for the
vector lane (D33). `doctor` reports configuration only; reaching the subscriber to check would make
the check emit an event of its own.

## D56 — The kinds that were declared and never emitted

**Problem.** D55 gave the log a live subscriber, which made a gap visible that had been harmless
while nothing watched: three of the things Engram does most often reached the log not at all.
`TelemetryEventKind.ServerStart` and `TelemetryEventKind.FileTouched` were declared constants with
**zero** emission sites, and the `user-prompt` hook — the one path that catches a fact the user
states in passing, which D51 describes as the capture that cannot depend on the model opting in —
had no kind at all. A subscriber therefore saw a system that edited nothing, started nothing, and
captured nothing, and the only honest reading of that feed was that the features were off.

**The capture event is its own kind.** `user-prompt`, not `remember`. Both end in a written fact,
which is the argument for merging them and exactly why they must not merge: D18 and D43 read
`remember` to answer whether *the model* reached for memory, and this path fires whether it did or
not. Folding them together would inflate the single number those gates turn on, in the direction
that looks like success — the same failure D43 traced to a count that meant one thing being read as
another.

It is emitted **after** the guard that asks whether anything was stored, not after the one that
asks whether anything was worth capturing. Every prompt reaches this hook and most carry nothing,
so recording the invocation would make the kind a proxy for "the user typed", which needs no
telemetry and which any live feed would render as memory activity that did not happen. The test for
this has to use a **restatement the store already holds** — a sentence that classifies exactly as it
did the first time and is then dropped as a duplicate — because that is the only arrangement where
the hook does all of its work and still writes nothing. Measured: moving the append above the guard
left the obvious test, an ordinary working prompt, **passing**, since such a prompt returns at the
earlier guard and never reaches either placement. That test asserts a real rule and says nothing
about this one.

**`server-start` is lifecycle, never a session count.** D14 retired an earlier record of this name
because one-per-process only meant "a session" when the transport was stdio, and a daemon mints many
sessions over one lifetime. That reasoning is about *counting sessions*, and `session-open` still
owns it; it left the lifecycle itself unrecorded, which is a different question and the one a
dashboard asks. `server-stop` is added as its counterpart and is best effort twice over: a process
killed outright never reaches `ApplicationStopping`, and even on a clean exit the only thing that
delivers events is the webhook service inside that same process, shutting down beside it. So its
absence proves nothing, and no reader may infer "still up" from having seen no stop — liveness is
pid plus start token, which `status` answers (D42).

**The edit event, and the measurement that nearly inverted the design.** `file-touched` holds a hard
10 ms budget and writes one spool file per invocation, on its own path, so the queue cannot lose an
entry to contention (D4). A telemetry record is a *shared* file, and the first question is whether
this hook can afford one at all. The answer is yes: **+0.11 ms at the minimum, +0.08 ms at p50** on
the published binary.

The first answer was **+0.78 ms**, and it was wrong in a way worth writing down, because it was
about to buy a whole subsystem. At that figure the write does not fit — a documented p50 of 7.82 ms
rising to 9.29 under an indexer-shaped writer lands the contended case past the budget — so the
write was moved out of the hook into a `SpoolPromoter`: a `BackgroundService` in the server that
polled the queue directory, promoted new entries into the log, and needed a starting mark, a
no-resume contract, and five tests of its own. It was built, and it worked. The number was an
artifact of the harness: the A/B loop ran the same arm first on every iteration, which charges arm A
whatever the first of a pair costs. Alternating the order, and calibrating by running the **same
binary against itself** — which reads ±0.07 ms — put the real cost inside the noise floor. The
promoter was deleted. Two rules follow. Alternate arms, always. And calibrate against a known zero,
because without it there is no way to tell a difference from the machinery measuring it.

**What a drop costs is load-dependent, so no test may assert a delivery rate.** The append passes
`TimeSpan.Zero` as its retry budget, the sole caller of the overload. That is not "retry briefly":
`DurableAppend` evaluates `elapsed < retryBudget` *before* its back-off sleep, so zero is exactly
one attempt and no sleep, and any small non-zero value is worse than either extreme — one collision
sleeps up to 20 ms against a 10 ms budget. Measured over ten rounds on an idle machine: 2.0% of
records lost at twenty concurrent editors, 1.6% at fifty. The same test **inside the full suite**,
where another class is running its own fifty-way burst, lost **30%**. Both are the design working —
a busy machine holds the log open longer, so more openers find it taken and drop, which is the
entire point of refusing to wait. Two assertions encoding a rate were written and both failed on
runs where nothing was wrong. What is asserted instead is everything that does not bend under load:
every spool entry survives, no line is torn, every record names a real edit exactly once, and
sequential edits lose nothing at all.

**A shared log has no total.** The server now writes its own records into `telemetry.jsonl`, which
broke an MCP end-to-end test that had been asserting a line count of five — the same trap the
session-start hook tests documented when the detached maintenance child started recording. Count by
kind, and name the kinds the exchange may produce; a total asserts something about the whole file
rather than about the thing under test.

## D57 — A handle that leads somewhere has to say so

**Problem.** Asked to show what a preference used to be, the tools could already answer:
`engram_recall` returns handles, `engram_expand … history` walks `FactStore.History` and returns the
closed facts along with the live one. No database access was needed and none of that is new. What
was new was watching it done on real data and noticing the answer arrived by luck.

`favorite color` returns **two** live facts, both saying green. One is a single version. The other
heads a thread whose previous entry says orange, closed thirty seconds after it was written. The
recall line — `[f4671] My favorite color is green. (user · 0d)` — is identical in shape for both,
because recall returns what is *believed*, and a belief that replaced something looks exactly like
one held all along. Expand the wrong handle and the tool reports `1 version`, which reads precisely
like *this was never revised*. The only thing that distinguished them was that the right one's body
happened to mention the old value in passing. That is not a design, and it fails silently in the
direction of asserting there is no history.

**So the line carries the thread length.** `CannedFact.Versions`, rendered as `· v2` when it exceeds
one, absent otherwise. The marker is not the history and does not try to be: it is the one bit that
turns choosing a handle from a guess into a lookup, and it costs three characters on the facts that
have it and nothing on the facts that do not. Inlining the previous version instead was rejected —
closed facts are by definition not believed, and spending the same token budget on them as on live
ones inverts what the budget is for.

**The count is keyed the way `History` addresses a thread, not the way the schema indexes one.**
`VersionCounts` groups on `e.path` and `f.predicate`. `subject_id` is the indexed column,
`ux_fact_live` is built on it, and it is the obviously right key for any other purpose — but this
number exists solely to advertise `History`, and `History` takes a path. Counting by a different key
than the call being advertised is how a marker comes to promise two versions and the expand it
invited returns one; paths follow their entity on rename (D2), so the two keys are not
interchangeable in a store old enough to have had one. `TheVersionCount_MatchesWhatExpandingTheHistoryReturns`
asserts the agreement directly rather than asserting a number, since a number can be right for one
store and the invariant is what has to hold.

**One query for the catalog, not one per fact.** Recall packs a handful of facts but ranks every live
belief in the store, so a per-fact lookup puts a round trip behind each of them. `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`
means the result holds only threads that were actually revised, which is a small set in any real
store — most beliefs are never replaced. A fact whose thread was not looked up reads as one version:
a count nobody took must not be rendered as a revision.

**Marking everything is exactly as useless as marking nothing**, which is why the unrevised case gets
its own guard at both tiers. Falsified both halves: forcing `VersionCounts` to match nothing fails the
two integration tests that expect a thread and leaves the control passing, and forcing the render never
to mark fails the unit test and leaves the plain one passing.

**Session lines carry no marker, and that is the addressing rather than an omission.** Recall renders
through three formatters — `FormatFactLine` for long-term facts, `FormatSessionFactLine` and
`FormatPriorSessionFactLine` for working memory — and only the first was given the marker, which
looks like a gap the moment anyone notices it. It is not, because a session note's subject path is
`/sessions/<id>[/<agent>]/<fingerprint(statement)>`: the leaf is a fingerprint **of the note's own
text**, so rewording a note addresses a different path and starts its own history rather than
extending the old note's. There is no earlier belief for a marker to point back at.

The cheap version of that reasoning — *session notes are never superseded* — is false, and believing
it would justify the wrong fix in either direction. Retract a note and restate it verbatim and the
path does collect two rows: `SessionFacts.Append` returns the existing id only for a **live** match,
and `FactStore.Forget` closes rather than deletes. So a session handle can head a two-version thread —
holding one sentence twice, since matching the path is what required the text to be identical. A
marker there would announce history carrying nothing the line above it already says. Both halves are
pinned by tests (`ARewordedNote_GetsItsOwnHandle_RatherThanBecomingAVersionOfTheOldOne`,
`ARestatedNoteAfterRetraction_HeadsAThreadHoldingOneStatementTwice`) rather than left as an argument,
because the property is invisible in the formatter and the next reader will otherwise re-derive it
from scratch or "fix" it. Falsified by dropping the fingerprint from `PathFor`, which makes the
reworded note land on the old path: 2 failed, 13 passed, restored.

Threading the count into the session tier was the other option and was rejected on cost against
value. `ReadLongTerm` and `SessionFacts.Read` are called on adjacent lines of `EngramMcpTools.Recall`,
so a shared map is reachable — but only by widening two public signatures used by the primer as well,
or by paying a second `GROUP BY` over `fact` on every recall, to light up a marker whose thread is a
restatement.

## D58 — Recall's latency target, measured at last, and what it costs

**Problem.** `docs/engram-spec.md:534` has asked for p50 under 50 ms on lexical recall since the
beginning, and nobody had ever measured it. Neither had anything exercised the stated benefit of the
no-ORM rule: there was no `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` anywhere in `src/` or `tests/`, so "hand-written SQL,
so query plans stay visible" described a property no one had looked at.

**The target is met today and missed at ten times today.** 16–21 ms through the published binary at
5,097 live facts **once its ~8 ms process start is subtracted** — ~24–29 ms on the wall clock — and
127 ms against a synthetic 50,097, ~135 ms on the wall clock. Carry that qualifier wherever these
numbers go: the target is about retrieval, and a hook or a command pays the start as well. What
matters is *how* it is missed:
by the **floor**. A query matching nothing costs the same as one matching everything — measured 87 ms
hot against 91 ms no-match on one run and 102 against 73 on another, where the spread within a query
exceeds the gap between queries. There is no hot case to optimise. Recall pays for the corpus, not
for the answer.

**Indexes are not the bottleneck and index tuning is not the fix.** Warm SQL is roughly 3 ms of an
18 ms pipeline at production size. Every plan is sane. `ReadLive`'s full scan is *inherent* rather
than a missing index — recall wants every live fact, and SQLite prefers the scan precisely because
`ORDER BY f.id` is then free. Anyone arriving here with an index to add should re-read this paragraph
first.

**The trap, which cost more time than the fix.** FTS match count does not predict cost. `index`
matches 45,119 rows and is fast; `latency` matches 45,001 and looked 8x slower. The discriminator
appeared to be *literal* token presence, because the overlap lane does not stem — and then even that
dissolved: the 8x was **explain-only overhead**, not recall's. D30 makes `explain` the measurable
proxy for the ranker, which is exactly what makes this easy to get wrong. Split `Pack` from `explain`
before drawing any conclusion from a number measured through the command.

**What was actually wrong was in `explain`, and it was two faults wearing one coat.**
`RetrievalExplainer.ReadTiers` bound one SQL parameter per candidate: at 50,000 candidates, a
50,000-parameter statement. This was described as a *latent* hard failure and it was not latent —
it was already firing. Measured as a controlled pair, the same store and machine, a binary built
from the commit before this work against one built after: `engram explain latency` on the 50,097-fact
store dies with **`SQLite Error 1: 'too many SQL variables'`**, because that query reaches 45,001
candidates against a default `SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER` of 32,766. So the 1,220 ms previously
recorded for a hot term is **time to crash, not time to answer**, and `explain` — the command D30
makes the measurable proxy for the ranker — was simply unusable on any store large enough to need it.
It now reads only as far as the caller renders — `Explain` takes a required
`displayLimit`, and `ExplainCommand` passes the `--limit` it already breaks its print loop on —
*and* chunks the read at 500 ids regardless, because `--limit` is a number a user types and a bound
a caller can raise is not a bound. `ExplainedCandidate.Tier` goes null past the displayed set, where
`WriteCandidates` already fell back to the candidate's origin.

Measured at 20,000 candidates, and the split between the two is not what it was designed to be: the
unbounded unchunked read costs **12.9x** the no-match arm, the unbounded but chunked read **1.89x**,
and both bounds together **1.3x**. Chunking was specified as the correctness half and turns out to
carry most of the latency at this size too. The controlled pair also produced **byte-identical**
`explain` output on every query the before binary survives (`pragma connection`, `zzzznomatch`,
`memory recall budget`), which shows that a null `Tier` past the display limit is invisible where
`WriteCandidates` falls back. Be exact about how far that reaches: it covers `FormatFactLine` and
nothing else. `zzzznomatch` renders zero candidates and so exercises no formatter at all, and none
of the three invocations passed `--session`, so `FormatSessionFactLine` and
`FormatPriorSessionFactLine` were never reached by it. The session formatters are covered by the
integration suite, which is where working memory is populated. The tier-3 guard therefore holds the pair rather than
each half — a ratio, on the model of `FileTouchedBudgetTests`, so a loaded machine moves both arms
together, and asserting exit 0 on every sample because the defect it catches is also reachable as a
throw, and a crashed arm would otherwise time as the fastest.

**The one recall-side change is a move, not a redesign.** `RecallEngine.BuildCandidates` built every
entry with its rendered line, including the majority the lane check then discards — on a no-match
query, all of them. The line is now built after that check, for exactly the survivors. The entry
carries the source fact rather than a `Func<string>`: both fact types are record *classes*, so this
is a reference copy, whereas a closure per entry would trade one allocation per fact for another on
the same O(corpus) path and buy nothing.

**Bounded materialization of the candidate set was designed, priced and deferred.** It buys 18 ms at
10x and about 2 ms at production. Its cost scales at ~0.4 µs per match against a floor scaling at
~2.5 µs per fact, so the floor breaches the target first at every store size — which is the whole
argument for not building it yet. The design exists and should not be re-derived: a bound of
`budgetTokens + 1` on overlap-only candidates is provably packing-exact, since RRF is strictly
decreasing in rank and every line estimates at least one token. Deferring it also keeps D44's
coverage inputs untouched, since coverage is computed from `candidates.Count` and
`Corroborated(candidates)` over the unbounded set.

**The floor work is the next scheduled item. It was going to be deferred behind a tripwire and that
ruling is withdrawn.** The tripwire was 15,000 live facts or a measured lexical p50 above 40 ms,
whichever came first, against today's 5,097 live. Those figures stand — but as the *pricing* of the
work, not as what authorizes starting it. The reason is that fact growth here is a **step function,
not a slope**: the code indexer adds facts in batches, so a single `engram index --apply` on a real
repository can consume the entire remaining headroom — 5,097 to roughly 17,000 — inside one command.
The fix, meanwhile, carries schema-migration lead time: a new derived table, a D31 snapshot on the
migration, and `repair` integration. **A tripwire that can be crossed faster than its fix can ship
is not a bound**, and that asymmetry, not the absolute numbers, is what changed the answer. The
floor still scales with **bytes, not rows**, and the code indexer remains the fastest-growing source,
so calendar time was never the right clock either.

**The design is chosen: an inverted literal-token index**, token → fact, over subject name plus body,
merged into the same integer overlap score the lane already computes. It won on being
**equivalence-testable**: it must produce identical scores and identical ranks to the lane running
today, which is diffable against a real store rather than argued. A retrieval change that can be
proven to change nothing is a different risk class from one that has to be believed.

Both alternatives were rejected on their merits, and the second is the dangerous one. **Precomputed
token sets** lose to the arithmetic: loading and intersecting 50,000 sets per recall is still
O(corpus), so the shape of the cost is unchanged and only its constant moves. **Restricting the
overlap lane to candidates the indexed lanes already returned** is worse than slow — it corrupts D44.
A lane that can only score what FTS handed it cannot independently corroborate FTS, so "two or more
lanes agree" decays toward a tautology, and coverage inflates in exactly the direction that looks
like success. That is the same failure D44 was written to fix, reintroduced one layer down.

**The catalog-versus-tokenizing split is unresolved and must be re-measured before any of that work
apportions effort.** At 50k the catalog read was recorded at **84 ms** against per-fact tokenization's
**59 ms**, which would make `FactCatalog.ReadLongTerm` the larger half — but that 84 ms came from a
Debug/JIT test host and does not reconcile with the published binary's 127 ms for the whole pipeline:
127 − 59 − 19 leaves about 49 ms, which has no room in it for an 84 ms read. One of those numbers is
wrong and it is most likely the JIT one. Re-measure on a Release build first. (An earlier 217 ms
reading for the same catalog read was a single cold JIT sample and is withdrawn outright.) Do not
treat 84 ms as settled, and do not choose where to spend the floor work until this is resolved.
`VersionCounts` deserves its own note regardless: it grows with total-ever-appended under an
append-only store even if the live set plateaus. 1 ms today, 17–19 ms at 10x.

**Errata, recorded so the wrong numbers are never cited again.** `TokenEstimator.Estimate` is
`Math.Ceiling(text.Length / 3.6)` — arithmetic on a string length, not a tokenization. A proposal to
defer it was rejected on exactly that ground, and it would additionally have blanked `explain`'s
`tok` column, which reads `Tokens` for every displayed row rather than only the packed ones. And the
1,200 ms hot-term figure measured `explain`, never recall — and, as above, measured it failing
rather than answering.

## D59 — The overlap index lands, and the boundary that decides what crosses into C#

**What this is.** D58 chose the inverted literal-token index and scheduled it as the next item. This
is the producer half, landed alone: `fact_token(token, fact_id)` is built, maintained and verified,
and **nothing reads it yet**. Splitting producer from consumer is deliberate — the index has been
maintained against every real write site, and compared against a from-scratch recomputation, before
any ranking depends on its answers. The cutover is its own change and must be equivalence-tested
against the lane running today, per D58.

**Maintained from C# chokepoints, never from SQL triggers.** `fact_fts` is trigger-maintained, so
the obvious symmetry is a trigger. It is not available: a trigger cannot call the tokenizer, so that
design needs tokenization expressed a second time in SQL, and the two agree exactly until one is
tuned. The failure after that is silent rather than loud — a term the index spells one way and the
query another scores zero, so the lane returns *less*, which reads as a corpus with nothing to say
rather than as a bug. The cost of the choice is that correctness now rests on call sites instead of
on the database, so the guard is the recomputation diff, not a unit test: drive every write site,
then compare the incrementally maintained table against `Rebuild`'s independent read of `fact`. A
forgotten `Add` or `Remove` is a set difference. Proven able to fail by commenting out
`FactJournal.Insert`'s `Add` — 2 red, restored, 7 green.

**Readiness is a stamped version, not a probe, and there is no scanning fallback.** An index built by
an older tokenizer is not corrupt; it disagrees. `fact_token_version` in `schema_meta` says which
tokenizer wrote the table, and anything other than a match means unbuilt. Because this is derived
state under D8, a rebuild can destroy nothing authored and needs no snapshot — unlike a migration
under D31 — and a version-behind table costs the overlap lane and nothing else rather than failing
recall.

**`--tokens` reads the stamp and nothing else, and that is a latency ruling.** A full rebuild costs
**297 ms at 5,097 live facts and 4,161 ms at 50,097** (50,561 and 701,358 token rows; +1.6 MB and
+20.5 MB vacuumed, so 305 and 410 bytes per fact). `MaintenanceLauncher` runs `repair --apply
--tokens` from the session-start child on **every session**, so row-level desync detection there
would put a scan of the whole token table on the session-start path unconditionally — the exact cost
the scoped mode exists to avoid, and the same rule D4 applies to `file-touched`. `CountMissing` and
`CountExtra` therefore live in the full `repair` verb, beside the FTS detector and for the same
reason: someone runs `repair` when they suspect a problem. The guard asserts **both halves**, because
the half that can rot is the one proving detection was *moved* rather than deleted — `--tokens`
leaves a planted row-level desync alone, and a full `repair` dry run still sees it.

**`NOT IN` beats `EXCEPT` here, and the tidy-up that would have equalized them costs 20 ms.**
`CountMissing` uses `NOT IN` where `CountExtra` uses `EXCEPT`, which reads as an oversight and was
reported as one during review. Measured at 50,097 live facts against 701,358 token rows, five
alternating runs each: **22 ms for `NOT IN`, 42 ms for the `EXCEPT` rewrite**. SQLite plans `NOT IN`
as a bloom filter probed while scanning `fact`; `EXCEPT` materializes a temp b-tree for the set
difference. The two detectors compute different set differences in opposite directions, so syntactic
consistency between them was never worth that. Recorded because the reversal is the point: the
finding was raised with confidence and measurement is what withdrew it.

**The zero-token exclusion is load-bearing in one direction only.** A live fact whose subject and
body are all stopwords or all sub-three-character tokens has no row in `fact_token` and is *supposed*
to have none. Counting it as a missed `Add` would leave `TokenIndexNeedsRebuild` permanently true, so
every `repair` would rebuild and none would ever stop the next one. The assertion that matters is
therefore the one *after* the apply, not the one before it. Zero such facts exist in this instance's
5,097 today, but nothing prevents one: there is no length validation on a body, and `EnsureEntity`'s
default name can be a single character.

**D58's parameter-ceiling defect recurred immediately, in new code.** `ReadManyForIndexing` bound one
parameter per candidate, and its candidate set is every live fact absent from the table — so an
unbuilt index on a large store was not a slow query but a throw past SQLite's 32,766 ceiling. Both
statements that size themselves from an unbounded collection now chunk at 500: the rebuild's token
stream and the candidate read. That this reappeared in the first new code written after D58 fixed it
in `RetrievalExplainer.ReadTiers` is the argument for the rule being stated as a rule — *a bound the
caller can raise is not a bound* — rather than as a fix to one function.

### The boundary: nothing O(corpus) crosses between SQL and C#, in either direction

The ranker design changed under review on a question that had no measurement behind it, only a
de-risking preference. The first cut kept the three lanes as separate statements and fused their
results in C# — 32 lexical pairs and up to 32 vector pairs per recall, which is small. It is still
wrong, for two reasons that are not about volume.

**Three statements are three snapshots.** A fact closed between the lexical read and the fusion
yields a rank pointing at a row the final read cannot see. One statement over one snapshot cannot
have that class of bug at all.

**And a lane that round-trips is a lane that can be tuned apart from the others.** D30 makes
`explain` a promise that it describes the ranker which actually runs; the more of the ranker lives in
C# glue between statements, the more surface there is for the two to diverge. So all three lanes,
the origin discriminator and the prior-session ordinal are inlined into a single statement with seven
bound parameters, and only the query terms and the embedding blob cross the boundary. SQL ranks and
bounds; C# formats and packs. The line is deliberately *not* built in SQL — that would duplicate
three C# format strings and their conditionals, which is the same drift argument that kept the
tokenizer out of triggers, pointed the other way.

Two details of that statement are worth stating because both fail silently. Coverage is computed with
`COUNT(*) OVER ()` and `SUM(is_corroborated) OVER ()`, which are exact over the unbounded set
*before* `LIMIT` — D44's inputs are preserved rather than approximated from the packed rows. And the
origin discriminator compares the session with `IS`, not `=`: with `=`, a null current session makes
every comparison null and every session fact falls to `ELSE`, which is the *correct* answer in that
case — so the bug would survive every test that had a session and every test that did not.

### Two documented SQLite practices, measured and rejected

Both are recommended by SQLite's own FTS5 documentation or by common practice, and neither helps
here. Recorded so they are not re-attempted.

**`ORDER BY rank` is slower than `ORDER BY bm25(fact_fts)`** at every query tried and at both store
sizes — including in the documentation's own documented shape, with no join and no filter, where
`bm25()` runs **8.96 ms against `rank`'s 13.25 ms**. The trap inside this one is worth more than the
result: `USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY` *does* disappear from the plan under `rank`, and the query is
still slower. **The absence of a temp sort is not evidence of speed**, and a plan read without a
clock attached would have concluded the opposite.

**`ANALYZE` changes nothing.** `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` output is byte-identical before and after, and
across nine timed comparisons four arms were faster and five slower — noise, not a signal.

**One correction to the record.** `FactStore.SearchRanked` is roughly **11.5 ms** at 50k, not the
40–45 ms previously carried, and it is **not** D58's floor: the same statement costs 0.011 ms on a
no-match query against 11.5 ms hot. The floor is what costs the same either way, which is the catalog
read and the per-fact tokenization — not this.

## D60 — The ranker becomes one SQL statement, and what the cutover found

**What this is.** D59's consumer half. `RecallRanker` produces the one ranking statement SQLite
executes; `RecallEngine.Explain` is demoted to test support. Four statement variants, chosen by
which lanes are available and cached by that key. The boundary D59 drew holds: SQL ranks and bounds,
C# formats and packs — the three format strings and `ApplyBudget` run unchanged over the bounded
set, because building the line in SQL would be a second implementation of them that drifts the first
time one is edited.

**Equivalence was tested against the ranker being replaced, at scale.** 764 queries across two
corpora, 5.8M candidate comparisons, element by element and field by field plus `TokensUsed` and
`Coverage`. Zero divergences outside the one documented §2.5 stopword-fallback case, which is
asserted by name rather than silently excluded. The lint that keeps it single is keyed on
`is_corroborated`, a token unique to this statement — accessibility never enforced "one producer",
since `EngramMcpTools` lives in another assembly and the class must be public.

**Ask for the windowed tie count, not the total.** The equivalence run's real question was whether
RRF ties order identically in SQL and in C#, and the first answer — a tie total — was useless. What
matters is ties *inside the window the statement returns*: 1,076 tie groups landed there and the
handle-ordinal tiebreak reproduced the oracle's order in every one. On the real store all 748 ties
are inside the window; the synthetic corpus buries 834,896 past position 501, so a total is
dominated by ties no caller can ever observe. A measurement that counts what is discarded reports
mostly noise and hides whether the part that ships agrees.

**The 501-row bound is exactly right for recall and was wrong for `explain`.** `budgetTokens + 1`
rows provably suffice to pack a `budgetTokens` budget — RRF is strictly decreasing in rank, the
order is fixed before the limit applies, and every non-empty line estimates at least one token. But
`explain`'s `--limit` can exceed the budget, and D30 makes it a promise about the ranker rather than
a view of the first 501 rows. `minCandidates` raises the floor for that one caller and provably
cannot move anything: coverage reads the window columns over the unbounded set, and `ApplyBudget`
stops at the first line that does not fit. Recall leaves it at 0.

**An unavailable lane deflates coverage silently, so it is now stated.** With one lane the
corroboration term degenerates to `(rank IS NOT NULL) > 1`, false for every row — so coverage can
never reach `high`, and an overlap-only fact is absent from the result entirely. The digest then
reads `coverage: none · gaps: no facts matched` about a store holding the answer, which is
indistinguishable from an empty store and ends D6's discover-then-remember loop before it starts.
The note is keyed to lane *state*, never to hit count: a query that matches nothing and a lane that
could not look call for opposite responses. `Unavailable`, never `Off` — D18 makes `Off` a supported
configuration and D37 says a diagnostic that reports a choice as a fault is one people stop reading.

**`json_each` costs nothing, so the four stable texts stay.** The open question was whether to
generate a literal `VALUES` list, which would make the statement text vary with term count. Measured
at 3 and 12 terms on both corpora, arms alternated every iteration and calibrated by running
`json_each` against itself: every delta sits at or below its own noise floor and the **sign flips**
across the four cells (−0.431, −0.425, +0.423, +8.337 ms against floors of 0.016, 0.228, 16.838,
6.635). Nothing to buy.

**The `versions` subquery was 93–99% of every recall, and a plan guard could not have said so.**
D57's thread count — one `COUNT` per returned candidate, so a line can carry `· v2` — was doing a
full scan of `fact` per row, because `ux_fact_live` indexes exactly those two columns but is partial
on `valid_to IS NULL` while a thread length deliberately counts closed rows. Measured against the
same statement with the subquery patched out: 1,545 ms → 105 ms at 50,097 facts for a term matching
45,132, and 31.8 ms → 1.0 ms at 5,308. The cost model is *candidates × corpus* and all four
measurements fit it within a factor of 1.7 (16–27M row visits/sec), so this was never a large-store
problem — only invisible at 5k, where the answer was 31.8 ms instead of 7. `ix_fact_thread` is the
same two columns without the predicate; schema version 5.

Three things about how this was found are worth more than the number. It **was** found during the
cutover, allowlisted in the §3.2 plan guard with an investigation and one candidate fix —
substituting the denormalized `fact.path`, which `ix_fact_path` already serves — and then correctly
escalated rather than decided, because that trade buys speed with a rename staleness window (D8).
The escalation was right and is why this was cheap to settle; an index is a third option that costs
nothing on either side, since it changes which rows are *found* and never which are counted. What
the escalation could not weigh is **how much** it was deferring, because a plan is not a clock:
§3.2 could see `SCAN f2` and had no way to see that it was 99% of the statement. Pair a plan finding
with a timing before ranking it. And the allowlist entry is deleted rather than annotated, so the
guard fails if the scan returns.

**A migration whose DDL is conditional needs a fixture that is actually missing it.** The version 5
guard asserted the right shape and could not see the wrong one: `WriteVersion1Store` builds its
"old" store by opening a *current*-schema one and rolling `schema_version` back, so the index was
already present and `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` no-opped. Measured — flipping the migration to
create a *partial* index left 18 of 18 green. Version 4's step escapes this only by accident of
shape, being an unconditional `DROP`/`CREATE` pair. The test now drops the index first, and that
same break reds exactly one test. The shape is asserted concretely (`subject_id,predicate
partial=0`) rather than only fresh-equals-migrated, because two stores that both lack the index
compare equal.

**D58's floor is gone, and the spec target is met at 50,097 facts.** Measured on the published
binary — the only measurement that counts, since D58's own reconciliation problem was a Debug/JIT
test host — with `probe` on the same home as the floor (process start plus store open, 11.6 and
11.9 ms), arms alternated, and one arm run against itself for calibration. Harness noise came out at
0.0–1.5 ms against effects of 6 to 1,600 ms.

| store · query | ranking, floor subtracted | without `ix_fact_thread` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5,308 · ordinary | 2.3 ms | 8.6 ms |
| 5,308 · hot | 3.2 ms | 33.0 ms |
| 50,097 · ordinary | **2.5 ms** | 91.8 ms |
| 50,097 · hot (45,132 matched) | 125.9 ms | 1,727.9 ms |

D58 recorded 127 ms at 50,097 and attributed the miss to the **floor** — "a query matching nothing
costs what one matching everything does" — because the object ranker read the whole catalog and
tokenized every fact per recall, whatever was asked. That is no longer the shape: an ordinary query
at 50,097 is **2.5 ms**, 50x better than the number D58 measured and below the 5,097 figure it
recorded as *meeting* the target. What remains is proportional to the match set, so the one case
still above 50 ms is a term appearing in 90% of the corpus, and that residue is D44's coverage
counts — window functions over the whole scored set — which is precisely what bounded
materialization was designed for. So D58's deferred item survives, retargeted from a floor that no
longer exists to a ceiling that does, and its tripwire (15,000 live facts, or p50 above 40 ms) is
void rather than unmet.

Two cautions on reading this. It is measured through `explain --limit 5`, which is not `Pack` —
`Pack` is reachable only through MCP, so no CLI path exercises it; the bound is identical, since
`minCandidates` of 5 loses to `budgetTokens + 1`, and what is added is explain's own rendering,
which the 2.3–2.5 ms ordinary-query figures bound tightly. And the index's effect is far larger here
than the test-host attribution suggested (37x on the 50k ordinary query, against roughly 75x
predicted from statement timings alone), which is the usual reminder that a component measured in
isolation and the same component measured through the shipping binary are two different numbers.

**Recall shed the catalog read; the primer did not.** `FactCatalog.ReadLongTerm` is what made the
object ranker O(corpus) whatever was asked, and `session-start`/`subagent-start` still call it — to
print a count line, a five-topic breakdown and two example bodies. That is the one place the
pre-cutover read survived, and D61 is where it was removed.

**Falsify against a committed tree.** The harness restored each arm with `git checkout --`, which
restores to HEAD — and the change under test was uncommitted, so every arm reverted the work instead
of the arm's patch and the "expect red" arms went red for the wrong reason. Separately, an earlier
arm's pattern spelled `·` as a bare `.`, one regex character against two UTF-8 bytes, so the patch
silently no-opped and the suite stayed green: a falsification reporting success while proving
nothing. Both are the same failure in different clothes, and the defence is the same one line —
assert the patch landed (`git diff --quiet`) before trusting an arm's result.

## D61 — The primer stops reading the catalog, and the hook that was waiting on its own child

Two changes that arrived together because measuring the first is what exposed the second.

**The primer's input is three aggregates, and `PrimerBuilder` keeps every rule.** `PrimerSummary`
carries a count, a topic histogram and a handful of example candidates; `From` builds it from a
catalog in memory and `Read` builds it from SQL, and the guarantee is that both produce primers
equal **byte for byte** — `PrimerSummaryEquivalenceTests` over ten corpora, plus the two precedence
values, since the precedence line is prepended before the budget is spent and a coverage line that
changed length could be dropped under one and kept under the other. The summary is deliberately
*unordered and unselected*: count-descending-then-key-ordinal, `MaxClusters`, `+N more`, the
preferred scope order and the fill-from-the-front all stay in `PrimerBuilder`, because a summary
that arrived pre-sorted would give the two paths a rule each to disagree about. For the same
reason the histogram groups by distinct subject **path** and lets `FactCatalog.TopicOf` resolve it
in C#: its segment splitting and topic-node lookup are one implementation, and a SQL copy would
diverge the first time either was tuned.

The candidate query reads the lowest-id live non-session fact per scope, unioned with the front
`$limit` of the catalog. That superset is provably everything `TopFacts` can reach *for any limit*,
which is worth stating because the first draft of the comment justified it for two and would have
misled whoever raised the constant. It also preserves the full *set* of scopes, so `OrderedScopes`
sees exactly what it saw before. `VersionCounts` — a catalog-wide `GROUP BY` — turned out to be
computed and never read by the primer at all; the candidates get a correlated count instead, keyed
on `subject_id` because `entity.path` is UNIQUE and the two groupings are therefore identical, which
does **not** reopen D57: that rule is about which thread a *number is advertised against*, not about
arithmetic.

Measured on the published binary, `subagent-start` — the clean isolate, since it builds the same
primer and spawns nothing — goes **69.5 → 43.4 ms over floor at 50,097 live facts** and 7.8 → 3.7
at 5,308, with the primers byte-identical on both binaries at both sizes. What remains at 50,097 is
the histogram, which transfers one row per distinct subject but still scans every live fact.

**A detached child was holding the hook's stdout, so every session start waited for the
housekeeping.** `MaintenanceLauncher` cannot `exec` its jobs the way `ServerLauncher` execs its one,
because it runs several; the adaptation wrote `{ … } >/dev/null 2>&1`, which replaces the *group's*
descriptors and leaves `/bin/sh` holding what it inherited until the slowest job finishes. Every
job's own output really was discarded, which is why it read as correct — and the class doc asserted
the property it had lost. A pipe reaches EOF only when its last writer closes, and Claude Code reads
this hook's stdout to receive the primer, so the wait was real and not an artifact of the harness:
`backup take`, `queue compact`, `repair --tokens` and `index --drain`, on the path of every session
start, which is the entire thing detaching exists to avoid. `exec` with no command, before anything
else, replaces the shell's own descriptors.

Measured as the difference between timing the hook through a pipe and through a file — which is
exactly that wait — **+76.6 ms at 5,308 and +44.0 ms at 50,097**, against **+0.4 ms** for
`subagent-start`, which forks nothing; −0.2 and −0.1 ms once fixed. The guard asserts the
redirection precedes the first job rather than timing a spawn, because the delay depends entirely
on how much housekeeping is due and an idle store is what a test starts with. Restoring the group
form reddens exactly one test; the theory that merely checks all three descriptors appear stays
green, which is the evidence that the placement assertion is the load-bearing half.

**The correction this forces, and the general rule.** A pair measured earlier had shown
`session-start` going 148.9 → 92.5 ms at 50,097 when the spawn moved above the primer's read, the
saving growing with the corpus, and it was read as `fork(2)` copying the parent's page tables. It
was the pipe: spawning earlier started the child earlier, so the timer stopped earlier, and the
saving tracked the corpus because the parent's read is what had been delaying the spawn. **A timer
that stops at EOF measures every process holding the pipe, not the one you launched** — so a hook
latency measured through a pipe may not be cited against a hook that spawns. The spawn costs
1.6–3.4 ms, which is what D28 recorded before any of this. The ordering was kept, since a fork is
never dearer for happening while the parent is small, but it is no longer justified by a number.
The telemetry-collision measurement that reorder forced — zero lost and zero torn across 160
session starts, because every caller but `file-touched` passes `DurableAppend` a 500 ms retry
budget (D56) — stands on its own and still applies.

**A tier that skips is not a tier that passed.** The two changes above were both found late, and
they were found late for one reason: `Engram.EndToEnd.Tests` skips every test when
`ENGRAM_TEST_BINARY` is unset, and the summary line counts passes. This suite was reported green
three times in a single session while **128 of its 161 tests were skipping**, which is also how
`ExplainCandidateScalingTests` sat red on `main` across several commits without anyone seeing it.
By D9 tier 3 exists because a green JIT build says nothing about what ships — so the run that drops
it is the run whose result means least, and it was the one that looked cleanest.
The first fix inverted which side needed a flag, on D49's reasoning that a default needing a flag is
not a default: an unacknowledged skip failed and named the commands that resolve it. **That was
reverted within the hour, and the revert is the more useful record.** Requiring a publish turned
every inner-loop `dotnet test` into a failure, which is D37's rule arriving in a new place — a check
people learn to route around is worth less than no check, and a test that cries wolf on the ordinary
case trains exactly that. `EndToEndBinary` now falls back to `./out/engram`, the location this repo
already publishes to, so a tree that has been published once runs tier 3 with no ceremony at all
(measured on this checkout: 128 skipped and one failure before, 156 passed and 5 skipped after,
without setting anything), and `TierThreeCoverageTests` reduces to naming the skip loudly when there
is genuinely nothing to drive. Automatic detection beats both flags: the failure mode was never that
someone declined to acknowledge a skip, it was that nobody noticed one.

The path-exists assertion survives the revert, for a reason measuring the four states turned up: a
variable pointing at nothing was assumed to skip like an unset one, and it does not — it fails 128
tests with `Win32Exception` from wherever each happened to start a process. Reducing that to one
line naming the cause is a different job from the skip guard beside it.

**`ExplainCandidateScalingTests` is deleted, and the deletion is the interesting part.** It seeded
20,000 facts sharing a token and asserted the hot arm stayed within 3x of a no-match arm, which is
what held D58's pair of bounds in `RetrievalExplainer.ReadTiers`. D60 then capped the candidate set
at `seed_k` per lane — that cap *is* the speed-up — so the hot arm became 32 candidates, both arms
collapsed onto the shared floor, and the 500-id chunking could have been deleted with the test
still green. It did not rot silently: it carried an explicit `of 20,000 candidates returned`
assertion added for precisely this, and that is the line that failed, which is a guard doing the
last useful thing a guard can do. Retuning the ratio was rejected — the arms can no longer be
separated by any margin — and so was rewriting it to reach SQLite's 32,766-variable ceiling, which
after D60 needs `seed_k` set above 32,766 in config and a 40,000-fact corpus to demonstrate: a slow
test defending a configuration nothing validates and nobody has set. The display bound keeps its own
deterministic, clock-free guard in
`RetrievalExplainerTests.Explain_ReadsTheProvenanceTierOnlyAsFarAsTheCallerWillPrint`. **The
chunking is now knowingly unguarded**, recorded here so that raising `seed_k` — or bounding it,
which nothing currently does — is understood to require restoring one.

*Open items deliberately left for later: entity-resolution fuzziness thresholds (start
exact + alias + case-insensitive, per spec §12); whether `UserPromptSubmit` recall
earns default-on (decide from M0/M1 coverage data); archive FTS for history search
(only if `LIKE` scans prove slow).*

## D62 — The PreCompact digest instruction: no channel collision, a line-anchored block, and a cap enforced downstream

Full design record and build order: `docs/session-capture-design.md`. This entry is the
transcription D61 asked for.

**The compaction-guard plugin does not collide, and the open question was answered by reading the
artifact rather than reasoning about it.**
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/jcline-claude-compaction-tools/compaction-guard/0.1.0/hooks/hooks.json`
registers `SessionStart` and `PostCompact` only; it has no `PreCompact` hook, and its directive
text never mentions `PreCompact`. Engram is the only writer on that hook's bare stdout — there is
no ordering to get wrong. What is real is an *instruction* interaction, not a channel one: guard's
directive addresses the assistant and is read by the summarizer as ordinary context it is
compressing; Engram's addresses the summarizer directly, out of band, at `PreCompact`. Two
instructions, one reader, different provenance. Three wording rules hold the two compatible, and
all three are load-bearing: the instruction opens by declaring itself an addition and says to write
the summary exactly as it otherwise would (guard's *preserve their wording* and a naive reading of
Engram's own compression are in direct tension the moment the block is read as applying to the
prose); it closes by stating its own subordination — any conflict with another instruction about
the summary and the other instruction wins, because a memory backstop that degrades the summary is
a net loss against a primary capture path that already works (106 `remember` calls against 0
`digest`); and it never names a tool, since the summarizer has none and an instruction its reader
cannot structurally follow only spends the attention it needs for the instructions it can follow.

**The format is `<engram-digest v="1">` / `</engram-digest>`, line-anchored, ASCII-only,
versioned, XML-ish rather than fenced.** Line-anchored because the alternative is a delimiter rare
in prose, and nothing is rare in prose these summaries actually produce. ASCII-only because D60
already paid for the alternative: a pattern spelling `·` as a bare `.` matched one byte against two
in UTF-8, the break silently no-opped, and the suite stayed green — a sentinel that a grep, a test
pattern and a C# literal must all spell identically has no business containing a multi-byte
character. Versioned so a parser that accepts only `v="1"` cannot be confused by a future `v="2"`
block, and so documentation can write an illustrative block that is not a live one by spelling it
`v="EXAMPLE"`, which a strict parser does not recognise as an open sentinel at all. XML-ish rather
than a fenced code block because fences nest badly and the facts this store holds are frequently
code-heavy — one backtick run inside an item would terminate a fence early.

**One item is one line, one self-contained sentence, and nothing else — no subject field, no
predicate field, no separator.** `SessionFacts.Append` does take an optional subject, so a
`subject :: statement` grammar was available and rejected: every inline separator available to
carry it is ambiguous against the prose these summaries contain (`::` is a C++/Rust scope operator,
`|` is a markdown table and a shell pipe, a bracketed prefix mis-splits this very repo's own
`[memory] precedence` line). A mis-split subject silently corrupts the statement, which is exactly
the partial garbage the harvester (todo 2) exists never to produce. If subjects turn out to be
needed they arrive at `v="2"` as their own full-line-anchored field, never as an inline separator.

**Parse strictness is split between block structure and item content, and conflating them is the
bug to avoid.** *Malformed input yields nothing, never partial garbage* is a rule about the block:
the open and close sentinels must each stand alone on their line; a non-blank line inside the block
that is not `- ` or `* ` followed by non-empty text (a heading, a sentence of prose, a fence) makes
the whole block malformed and the record yields nothing; an unterminated block yields nothing.
**If more than one well-formed block is present, the harvester takes the last one, not "reject the
record."** Earlier blocks are echoes — of the design doc, of the instruction, of the previous
compaction's summary sitting at the head of the new context — and rejecting on duplicates would
fail systematically from the second compaction onward, and permanently in a repo whose own docs
contain the sentinel. This is safe because replay is already idempotent: `SessionFacts.PathFor`
fingerprints the statement, and per D57 `Append` returns an existing id for a live match, so the
same sentence harvested twice in one session resolves to one fact. Item-level problems are a
different rule and **drop the item, not the block**: longer than 500 characters, or a duplicate of
an item already taken from the same block. No minimum length — a length floor is a poor proxy for
self-containedness and would reject a legitimately terse fact.

**The cap is 25 items, enforced by the harvester, not trusted from the instruction.** The
instruction states the limit so the summarizer *selects* rather than dumps; the harvester takes the
first 25 after filtering, because that is what actually bounds the corpus, and items seen versus
items taken are both recorded so the two can disagree visibly. Putting the cap at the harvester
makes it a lever: the growth regime is still an open question (five compactions a day at cap is
~45,000 facts a year, against a store where a term matching most of 50,097 facts costs 125.9 ms —
D58/D60), and 25 can be lowered later without touching the block format, the instruction, or
anything already harvested.

**No per-compaction nonce in v1**, same reasoning shape as D58's rejected tripwire. The channel
rests on one probe against one manual compaction; requiring the summarizer to copy a nonce verbatim
adds a second, independent failure mode to an unproven first one, and when nothing is harvested
*ignored* and *fumbled the nonce* would be indistinguishable. The escalation trigger is concrete
rather than a vague "if this proves unreliable": add a nonce at `v="2"` the first time either the
instruction's own placeholder text (`one durable fact, on one line`) turns up in the store — meaning
the echo path fired — or harvest is asked to run over content that did not originate with the
summarizer.

Open past this decision, and left to whoever designs todo 2: whether harvested items may supersede
existing facts or only append; the growth-regime cap number, which needs the real rate measured
first; and scope/privacy — widening automatic ingestion from the user's words to the assistant's
reasoning, which is explicitly the user's call, not the implementor's, and blocks todo 2 but not
todo 1.

## D63 — D18's gate has real evidence now, and it currently passes

**Finding.** D44 left D18's bar unmet for lack of exercise, not for failing it: the only recorded
`coverage: none` events were cold start, so the vocabulary-mismatch case the vector lane exists for
had never actually been tested end to end. Measured 2026-08-09: 5 fresh paraphrase probes against
the live store, each deliberately reusing none of the target fact's wording (the same shape as
D18's own "kid's name" vs. "son is Liam" example), drawn from real `/user/about-you` facts several
days old — not synthetic, not cold-start. 4 of 5 surfaced the exact target fact as a top-ranked hit
at the default 300-token budget. The 5th ("stray extra process in the wrangl agent list" against a
fact about a `tmuxCc`/`tmux-cc` config typo) returned nothing at default budget but surfaced the
fact at rank 7 of 10 once the budget was raised to 1500 — a ranking/budget interaction, not a
`coverage: none` miss, so it doesn't bear on D18's stated criterion. 0 of 5 genuine misses; 0
`coverage: none`.

**What this changes and what it doesn't.** D18's criterion — "no recorded query has yet missed a
fact that existed at the time it was asked" — now passes on every query recorded to date, including
these five and the ones D44 already accounted for. It does not close the way a one-time test closes:
the bar is cumulative, and any future genuine miss reopens it. 5 hand-picked probes over a corpus of
a few thousand personal facts is real evidence that the vocabulary-mismatch case works, not an
exhaustive benchmark of it. It also answers retrieval quality only — whether the agent reaches for
the vector lane on its own, rather than being deliberately probed, is the separate adoption question
D12/D43 already left open, and this finding does not touch it. The rank/budget interaction on probe
5 is worth a follow-up if `coverage` keeps hiding relevant-but-low-ranked facts at default budget —
a quality note, not a blocker to this gate.

## D64 — Two-field memory: a statement every fact carries, and depth it may defer

**Decision.** `engram_remember` and `engram_revise` gain an optional `details` parameter alongside
`statement`; `fact.details` is a new nullable column, belief content like the body it accompanies —
append-only, never indexed, never compared for replay identity (D8). Recall packs the statement (or a
truncated legacy body); `engram_expand ... details` pages the rest. Three rungs, each an explicit,
priced step deeper — the same pattern the toolchain already runs on (skill description → skill body,
deferred tool name → fetched schema, Read's offset/limit): the recall line (statement, or a body
truncated to 100 tokens on a word boundary, plus a `· +Nk` marker sized to everything withheld); the
first page of `expand details` (`budget_tokens`, default 800); further pages via a stateless character
`offset`. A details-fact and a legacy long-body fact ride the same ladder — the model never needs to
know which kind it is looking at.

**`statement` is never rejected for length; `details` is, hard, at 2,000 tokens — the asymmetry is
deliberate.** Hard rejection on `statement` was designed first and struck on review, for three
reasons: the store's own history is the evidence against it — mean 112 characters, p90 200, achieved
under nothing but the advisory "short, self-contained" already in the tool description, so soft
guidance already yields roughly 97% compliance; a bounced write risks losing the capture outright — a
model that hits a wall may chop its statement to fit (discarding depth rather than moving it
somewhere real) or give up on saving at all, and D51's argument ("a capture the model has to opt into
is a capture that does not happen") applies with more force to a capture that was attempted and
refused than to one merely encouraged toward brevity; and the read path has to defend against an
over-length body regardless, since hooks are exempt from the advisory and legacy long bodies already
exist, so rejecting statement would buy only behavioral pressure the data says is unneeded, at a
capture-loss price a truncated recall line does not carry. `details`, in contrast, is never passively
captured — always deliberately authored by a model that can retry with a pointer (a path, a handle)
in the same breath — so refusing it loses nothing, and "a memory that large is a document; store
where to find it rather than its contents" is the refusal's own text.

**The ceiling is enforced once, ahead of both call sites, deliberately as one implementation.**
`EngramMcpTools.DetailsCeilingError` is called by both `engram_remember` and `engram_revise` before
either opens a connection — "same check, same message shape" written once rather than twice, so the
two tools cannot drift into checking different limits or wording their refusals differently.

**Paging is the recall budget idiom plus the Read tool's offset idiom, not page-number machinery, and
it is stateless on purpose.** `expand ... details` renders from a character `offset`, cuts at the
budget on a word boundary (never mid-surrogate-pair), and appends a continuation line
(`showing chars A–B of N · continue with offset: B`) — or nothing, on the terminal page, because an
ever-continuing pager reads as more content existing when none does. Character offsets rather than
token offsets, because they are exact and stable and token math is arithmetic on a length anyway
(D58's `TokenEstimator`). No cursor is held server-side; the offset round-trips through the caller,
which is what lets a stateless MCP tool serve it at all.

**`details` is indexed nowhere in v1 — FTS, the token-overlap lane, and the vector lane all continue
to read `body`/`statement` only** — for four reasons, in order of weight: the contract already demands
the statement carry the searchable essence, so a statement whose distinguishing keyword lives only in
its details has failed its own contract and the fix is a better statement, not a bigger index; lane
symmetry keeps D44's corroboration (2+ lanes agreeing on one candidate) meaning agreement about one
text rather than two lanes seeing different documents; the blast radius collapses to zero schema or
trigger changes and no tokenizer-version bump (which would force a full token rebuild — 4.16 s at
50,097 facts, D59) and no embedding-space question (D18/D38); and it is reversible in the direction
that matters — indexing details later is additive, un-indexing it later strands expectations. Named
revisit condition, not vibes: recorded recall misses (D44's method — check `valid_from` against the
telemetry timestamp before trusting any miss) whose query terms lived only in a details field and
nowhere in the statement.

**Replay identity is unchanged, and `details` deliberately plays no part in it.** `backup replay`
still matches on subject, predicate, body, and `valid_from` exactly as D32 defined it; `details` rides
along on insert and is never compared, so a journalled fact whose body matches the target's is
`AlreadyPresent` even when their `details` differ. Depth is not identity; the belief is the statement.

**`engram_revise` never carries `details` forward.** Omitting it on a revision means the new version
has none, full stop — `FactWrite.Details` is always exactly what the caller passed, never
`?? target.Details`. Carrying stale details onto a revised statement would manufacture the exact
born-inconsistent pair (a corrected belief paired with an uncorrected elaboration of the old one) this
design exists to avoid.

**Rejected: depth as a linked child fact**, a second row under the same subject rather than a column
on the same row. A two-call write breaks atomicity (a crash between the two calls orphans the depth);
superseding the summary orphans or strands the child; the child competes in recall ranking as its own
candidate and pollutes results unless filtered by more machinery than the feature is worth; and the
recall marker would need a join just to know depth exists at all. The nullable column is strictly
simpler on every axis, at the cost of nothing D8 protects — `details` is exactly as append-only as
`body`, closed the same way, by the same supersession.

**`ApplyBudget`'s break→skip reversal is this feature's own precondition, not a separate change riding
along with it.** A details-bearing or truncated-legacy fact that ranks first and does not fit the
budget must not empty the whole digest the way the old stop-at-first-misfit contract would have let it
— that failure mode reads to the model as "the store knows nothing" (the same principle D57's marking
discipline generalizes: a digest gone silent over one oversized winner is worse than one that skips it
and packs what fits). Formatting-time truncation, below, keeps that skip rare in practice, but the
skip is what keeps an untruncated legacy body or a details-heavy fact from being able to poison the
digest at all.

**The equivalence trap fired twice, and neither arm was loaded until proven.** `CannedFact.DetailsChars`
and its session-tier counterpart on `SessionFact` are each computed by two independent derivations —
one reading `StoredFact.Details` in C#, one reading a `COALESCE(length(f.details), 0)` SQL column —
and `RecallRankerEquivalenceTests` is the instrument meant to catch them disagreeing. Dropping either
long-term derivation did not redden that test against its existing fixture, because no seeded fact had
ever set `Details`; the same was true, independently, for the session-tier pair. The fixture was
strengthened (one details-bearing long-term fact, one details-bearing fact in each session origin) and
both pairs of derivations were falsified again — each now reddens on its own, with an exact `Line` and
`Tokens` mismatch, and passes once restored. A lint or guard test that cannot fail is worthless until
someone deliberately breaks the rule it exists to enforce and watches it get caught — this is that,
twice, for a guard the spec asserted was already armed.

**Falsified, each broken, reddened, restored, re-greened:** `ApplyBudget`'s skip; the details ceiling
on both tools (writes nothing, exact message); revise's no-carry-forward (details leaked through when
defaulted to `?? target.Details`); the paging word-boundary progress guard (`lastSpace > offset` —
without it, a page cut lands on its own leading space and cannot advance); the surrogate-pair split
guard (an emoji orphaned across a page boundary without the low-surrogate step-back); `budget_tokens <
1` (an unguarded zero throws `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` from `LastIndexOf`, not merely returns a
bad value); the withheld-chars marker's iff (forcing it always-on reddens the no-marker case on a
literal `+0`); and both `DetailsChars` derivations, long-term and session-tier, independently.

**Not measured:** whether a model, given the advisory clause, actually keeps statements short in
practice under this tool description specifically — the ~97% figure is the store's history under the
OLD description, before `details` existed to redirect depth toward. Worth reading back after some
adoption, the same way D18/D43 read recall adoption back.

## D65 — `restart`: composes Stop and Start, adds no kill path

**Decision.** `engram restart` is `Stop` then `Start`, nothing else. `ServerLifecycle.Start`
already replaces a wedged or version-mismatched server on its own — it `TerminateAndWait`s the
impostor and launches — so restart's entire delta over `start` is one case: a **healthy**
same-version server, which `Start` alone reports `AlreadyRunning` on and leaves running. Stopping
first closes that gap. Nothing running is not an error — `restart` just starts, exit 0,
`systemctl restart` semantics on a stopped unit. No new kill path exists: termination is still
only ever token-verified (D42), riding the same `TerminateAndWait` both `Stop` and the wedged
branch of `Start` already called.

**The wait-after-Kill gap in `TerminateAndWait`, and why restart is what surfaced it.** Before
this, `TerminateAndWait` escalated Terminate → poll → Kill and returned immediately after calling
`Kill`, without re-checking `IsRunning`. A SIGTERM-ignoring server can still hold its port for a
moment after SIGKILL while the kernel tears it down; plain `stop` never noticed, because nothing
bound the port again right after it returned. `restart` does — its `Start` half binds that same
port seconds later — so a race that was latent under `stop` becomes an intermittent
`PortHeldByStranger` under `restart`. Fixed by re-entering the same poll loop after `Kill`,
reusing `TerminateTimeout` rather than adding a new timeout field, since SIGKILL cannot be ignored
and this second window only ever covers kernel teardown. `stop` gets the fix for free, since both
call the one shared method.

**No `engram_restart` MCP tool**, for the same reason `start.md` already gives for cold start:
reaching an MCP tool at all proves the server is up, and the reply dies with the process that
would have served it. Restart is inherently something reached from outside the process it acts on.
No `--force`/`--kill` flag either — `Stop` already escalates Terminate → Kill on its own timeout,
and a flag would be a second way to say the same thing.

**Falsified:** the wait-after-Kill fix, with a fake `IProcessInspector` that reports still-running
for one poll after `Kill` before going dead — reverting to return-immediately-after-Kill drops the
assertion that a poll observed that transient true, showing the old code could return before the
pid was actually gone. And the load-bearing one for `restart` itself: skipping the `Stop` call
(calling `Start` alone) against a healthy running server yields `AlreadyRunning` with the same
pid, unchanged — proving restart's only behavioral difference from `start` is exactly that one
case.

## D66 — `memory-guard`: a PreToolUse checkpoint on file-based memory, not a block

**Decision.** The plugin gains a PreToolUse hook on `Write|Edit|MultiEdit` routing to `engram
hook memory-guard`. A write to `<projects>/<slug>/memory/*.md` — `MEMORY.md` exempt by exact
ordinal basename, since it is the index and never memory content — denies once per session with
a reason naming `engram_remember`, then allows silently for the rest of the session; re-running
the identical call proceeds immediately. `[memory] precedence = off` is the only switch (a second
`nudge` key would be two ways to turn one thing off, D55); every other case — non-matching path,
the index file, an uninitialized home, missing `session_id`/`file_path` — allows with no output.
The hook's existence is itself the answer to whether Engram is installed, matching how
`ensure-server` already runs at session start; no separate flag, no server-aliveness check.

**Fail open, and never opens the database** — the same two rules D4 already established for
`file-touched`, for the same reason: a state-append failure allows rather than denies (a nudge
that cannot record itself must not re-fire forever), an unreadable config falls back to
`MemorySettings.Default` rather than throwing, and the non-matching fast path is parse-stdin ->
path check -> exit 0, PreToolUse's own frequency class being identical to `file-touched`'s.

**The shared `File.Exists(home.ConfigPath)` gate in `HookCommand.Run` stays; memory-guard's own
ordering rule narrows to what that gate leaves undecided.** A falsification built to prove "the
path check precedes every home/config touch" could not fail under a broken ordering, because that
existing gate — priced into `file-touched`'s measured budget already — answers the probing
scenario before `RunMemoryGuard` ever runs, correct or broken alike. The rule inside
`RunMemoryGuard` narrows to what is actually distinguishable — no config parse, no state or
telemetry or database touch before the path-match check — stated as a comment, since ordering of
side-effect-free checks cannot fail a test by construction. What replaced the falsification is
`NonMatchingPath_LeavesNoTrace`: a non-matching path against an initialized home must leave no
state file and no telemetry record, which does red when the state append moves above the path
check.

## D67 — A repo is indexed because someone said so, and the decision outlives everything derived from it

**D67. A repo is indexed because someone said so, and the decision outlives everything derived from
it.**

Two defects, one root. Nothing triggered a reindex on out-of-band change — the spool queue is written
only by the `PostToolUse` edit hook, so a `git pull`, a rebase or a branch switch never entered it —
and a never-indexed repo was never indexed automatically, because session start passes `--drain` and
an empty queue did not escalate. Measured on this repository before the repair: a full dry run
reported 42 facts to write, 695 to close and 3 files deleted, against 504 recorded index events and
`auto_index_on_session_start = true`. A keyhole index reads exactly like a working one.

The fix is that enrollment becomes a thing a user decides, `repo_enrollment` records it, and freshness
follows from the record rather than from whichever files an editor happened to touch.

**It is a table of its own, and `repo_registry` was the wrong home for a specific and verifiable
reason.** `StoreCompactor` counts `repo_registry` rows under a path prefix and then `DELETE`s them
(`StoreCompactor.cs:110`, `:168`). That table is already treated as derived state compaction may
destroy — correctly, since it is the residue of an index pass. Putting a decline there means
`engram compact` silently un-declines a repo and the user is asked again, which is D8's line with a
live `DELETE` on the wrong side of it. Two further reasons close it: a declined repo is by definition
never indexed, so it never acquires a registry row at all, and it would need a row in a table meaning
*this repo has been indexed* to record *this repo has explicitly not been*; and `detached_at` is a
filesystem observation cleared on every re-home (`CodeIndexer.cs:667`), so a decision stored beside it
is erased the first time the checkout is seen again. `repo_enrollment` is excluded from
`StoreCompactor` explicitly rather than by absence from a list, and a test enrolls, compacts, and
asserts the enrollment row survives while the registry row does not.

**Keyed on `identity`, because the registry already is.** Re-homing looks up by identity alone
(`CodeIndexer.cs:657`) and `disk_path` is never a lookup key, so this inherits re-homing rather than
reworking it — and inherits its known limitation, that two clones of one remote on one machine share
an identity, which is pre-existing and not widened. `last_root` is a lookup *cache*, never the key: a
stale one falls back to resolving identity. Keying enrollment differently from the registry would give
one repo two keys that can answer differently, and the first divergence is a repo that reads as
enrolled to one caller and unknown to another.

**A NULL scan stamp is what makes the first index full, and that must stay a consequence rather than a
flag.** `last_full_scan_at IS NULL` means due, so a newly enrolled repo full-scans on its first run
with no special case anywhere. This is load-bearing well beyond convenience: the global drain
*discards* queued entries for repos it cannot service, and that is lossless only because any such repo
is full-scanned before its next drain — which lifts D41's fold argument from path granularity to repo
granularity (a full scan re-reads every file, so it carries whatever the discarded entries carried).
The guard for it stamps `last_full_scan_at` at enrollment time and asserts the first index then
*fails* to see an untouched file. Passing `--full` explicitly at the enrollment spawn would produce
the same scan today and permanently disarm that falsification, so the enrollment job deliberately does
not carry the flag. A truncated scan never stamps, for the mirror reason: stamping one means a large
repo is scanned once, marked fresh, and never fully scanned again.

**The prompt and the mechanism live in different channels, which is D51 applied rather than excepted.**
D51's capture trigger is unconditional, so it fits a compile-time `[Description]`. This trigger is
conditional on the state of the working directory, which a `[Description]` cannot express — so the
*condition* rides the primer and the *mechanism* stays in the tool description. Inverting either half
breaks something nameable: a condition in the description fires in every enrolled session, and a
mechanism in the primer needs a second D15 exemption. There is exactly one such exemption and it stays
at one.

**The session-start hook decides "is this a checkout" from the filesystem, and the CLI asks git.** They
are different questions asked under different budgets. The hook may not spawn `git rev-parse` on its
own clock (D4), and it needs the *checkout root* rather than the working directory, because `last_root`
stores the root — a lookup keyed on cwd misses for every session started in a subdirectory, which
presents as an enrolled repo that re-prompts forever and is indistinguishable from a user who never
answered. So the hook walks up testing for `.git` as **either a file or a directory** (a linked worktree
and a submodule have it as a file holding `gitdir:`). D53's scan budget does not reach this: D53 bounds
tree *enumeration*, and a walk-up visits one directory per path component and enumerates none. The two
answers diverge on an ambient `GIT_DIR`, on a `.git` file pointing at a deleted gitdir, and on a bare
repo; each divergence costs at most one wasted prompt, and the hand-typed verb still asks git before
writing anything.

**`--auto` gates ambient work and may not gate commanded work.** This was got wrong first and is worth
recording as a rule rather than as a fix. `auto_index_on_session_start` answers *may Engram index on
its own*, and the enrollment spawn reused the session-start job list, which carries `--auto` — so with
the setting off, `engram repo enroll` announced a background index and performed none. The setting
suppresses everything unsolicited (the primer line, the session-start scan) and nothing commanded;
with it off the model never offers enrollment, so the only route to the verb is a human typing it. The
launcher now takes a jobs discriminator, and the enrollment job is the index alone with neither
`--auto` nor `--full`. Dropping `--auto` loses nothing else, and that was checked rather than assumed:
its three other conjuncts are already satisfied at that call site by construction — the checkout was
verified before anything was written, the database obviously exists because a row was just written to
it, and the enrollment check is true *because* of that write. None of them may be re-added "for
safety"; the last would be a race against the write that makes it pass.

**The `last_root` repair for a moved checkout is not the only stamp on that column, and neither
stamp may be deleted as a duplicate of the other.** At the top of `CodeIndexer.Index`, after
resolving identity, an enrollment row whose `last_root` disagrees with the resolved root gets it
rewritten (`CodeIndexer.cs:88-92`) — but `RepoEnrollment.IsEnrolled` also stamps `last_root`
(`RepoEnrollment.cs:101`), and on the detached maintenance child's `--auto` pass that one runs
*first*, before `Index()` is ever entered, so on an ordinary session start it is the stamp that
actually heals a moved repo, not `CodeIndexer`'s own. `CodeIndexer`'s stamp is the only one
reachable on a commanded pass, where the `--auto` gate never runs. The pair is what lets
`IsEnrolled`'s `git remote get-url origin` subprocess stay off the session-start hook's own clock
(D4): cut both and a moved repo either mis-prompts forever or that subprocess goes back onto the
hook's budget. Guards 12b and 12c hold this, and 12c is the one that falsifies `CodeIndexer`'s
stamp alone.

**The `--auto` gate's enrollment conjunct resolves in two steps, and only the first may run on the
hook's own clock.** `RepoEnrollment.IsEnrolled` tries the cache-only `ByRoot` lookup first — a
`last_root` match, no subprocess — and only on a miss falls back to `CodeIndexer.ResolveIdentity`
(one `git remote get-url origin`) and a lookup by identity, stamping `last_root` on a hit. The
session-start hook computes the primer from step one alone; a miss there reports the repo as not
enrolled to the primer, and step two runs only inside the detached maintenance child, off the
hook's latency budget entirely (D4). Guard 12a holds the hook side of this: the hook stays
cache-only across two session starts with no index pass between them, and the enrollment line
keeps appearing rather than disappearing on a coincidental hit.

**A repo moved on disk produces one wrong prompt, not zero.** The repair is asynchronous — it
rides the detached maintenance child, so sessions started faster than that child completes each
get their own wrong prompt. In practice that is one; two panes opened at once against a checkout
that just moved is the case where it is two. Not worth fixing: the alternative puts a git
subprocess back on the session-start hook's own clock, which is exactly what D4 refuses. A repo
that moved and whose remote also changed is a new identity, and is asked again.

**The queue is scoped by view, not by flag, and the abstraction that forced this is the general
lesson.** `SpoolQueue.Consume` deletes files and never mutates its own captured list, while `Pathless`
counts that whole list with no root parameter — where `Under`, `LeftBehind` and `Consume` all take a
root. Under one-root invocations those two scopes are indistinguishable, so the type was
correct-by-coincidence for its entire life. The first pass covering several roots pulls them apart:
one bare timestamp would escalate *every* enrolled repo to a full scan, which is unbounded in the
number enrolled. The fix is a derived view with the rescan signals filtered out, so the escalation
condition reads false **by construction** for secondary roots and the line that tests it is unchanged.
Two alternatives were rejected: making `Consume` shrink its list turns a snapshot into a stateful
object whose readings depend on call order, and works only because the invoked root happens to run
first — a fix whose correctness depends on iteration order breaks silently when the loop is reordered;
and a suppression flag is the right semantics expressed as a boolean a call site can pass wrong.
Nothing tested `SpoolQueue` directly before this, so neither wrong fix would have reddened anything —
absence of tests is not absence of dependents, and a contract change on an untested type is the worst
quadrant. The type now has its own tests, and the non-mutation is pinned as *deliberate* with the
reason, so the next person meeting the symptom does not "fix" it by making `Consume` stateful.
Generally: **a type whose methods mostly take a scope parameter, with one that does not, is a
conflated abstraction waiting for its second caller.**

**The queue's only bound is the drainer discarding what it cannot service, and leaving it alone was
tried on paper and refused.** `file-touched` may not open the database (D4), so it cannot know which
repos are enrolled and spools for all of them forever; `SpoolCompactor` **folds** rather than prunes,
bounding the residue by *distinct path count* and never to zero. So "harmless until that repo enrolls"
has no discharge condition — a **declined** repo never enrolls — and the residue grows monotonically
with every distinct file ever edited in any repo Engram was told not to index, read by every `Peek` in
every repo. That residue is the measured symptom this change exists to remove: 272 entries across five
repos on the instance where it was found. `DiscardExcept(servicedRoots)` deletes exactly the complement
of what the pass serviced, and *serviced* means accumulated as the loop drained — never re-derived from
the enrolled set, since an enrolled repo whose checkout is absent is deliberately not serviced and its
entries are discarded. Two skips inside it are load-bearing in opposite directions. Pathless entries are
skipped unconditionally, and the reason for that had to be corrected during review: a bare timestamp
*is* discharged, by the invoked root's own escalation (`CodeIndexer.cs:115`, `:235`), so the skip is
not what keeps a watermark alive on an ordinary pass. It is what stops `DiscardExcept` from ever being
the thing that destroys one — on a pass where no root escalates, which the deferred server-side
freshness service produces on every tick that finds no repo due, an unskipped watermark would be
deleted with nothing having scanned for it. It is also what makes the call safe on the full snapshot,
since `Consume` deletes the file and leaves the entry in the list. And `Kind.Unreadable` is skipped
because an unreadable entry has no trustworthy path, so *under none of these roots* is trivially true
for it and the naive implementation destroys a possibly-good edit record on a **transient**
`FileShare.None` collision. D41 already says bytes that could not be obtained are left alone; this is
the first caller that could have broken that rule by accident. Rejected shapes, each for a reason worth
keeping: a `RootsOfRemaining()` accessor would make the type walk the filesystem per entry to answer a
question about itself; a bare rootless `Consume` overload reads as *consume everything* on a delete
method; and `Consume(root: "/")` is not merely fragile — it deletes the wrong set, every path-bearing
entry including repos the pass has not reached.

**Telemetry records the action, not the state, and the two vocabularies are allowed to differ.**
`enrollment` events carry a `Decision` of `enroll`, `decline`, `later` or `reset` — four verbs against
the table's three states, because `reset` deletes the row and produces no state at all. The reason is
written beside the field, or someone harmonizes them and `reset` becomes unrecordable. It is not
folded into `Phase`, which D55 gives a durational meaning that an instantaneous decision has no second
half for — that reuse is precisely the shape D43 traced a wrong published conclusion to. It is not
folded into the `index` kind either, since D18 and D43 read kinds to answer how memory is used and an
enrollment decision is not an indexing run. The migration's backfill emits **nothing**: one event per
pre-existing repo would put a burst into the log at the exact moment the feature ships, inflating
every count over the kind on its first day, so the absence is commented as decided. Emission sits at
one point below both the CLI verb and the MCP tool; there was no such point before, and creating it is
part of the change, because per-surface emission is how a kind ends up recorded from one surface and
silently not from the other.

**The migration backfills to enrolled, which narrows nothing.** Before this, `--auto` indexed *any* git
checkout when the setting was on, gated on nothing else — strictly broader than "every registry row".
Backfilling every row with a non-NULL `disk_path` to `enrolled` therefore switches nothing off, while
requiring re-consent would silently disable a working setup nobody asked to change. `source`
distinguishes the inference from a real answer, so "why are forty repos being scanned" stays
answerable. Rows with a NULL `disk_path` are skipped and asked about if the checkout returns, and
every backfilled row gets a NULL scan stamp — which is the one-shot repair of the original defect.

**Freshness rides the session-start child rather than the server, and the acceptance property is that
the feature works with the server never started.** The server can be down, wedged or
version-mismatched — D42 exists because callers kept enumerating those states wrong — and indexing
freshness must not inherit that vocabulary. A server-side service is a genuine improvement for
mid-session freshness and for repos where no session ever starts, and it is deferred rather than
declined; the end-to-end guard that enrolls, edits a file out of band, starts a session and asserts
the change is indexed **with no server at any point** is what stops it from quietly becoming the only
path.

**One retired key, on D33's pattern, and a second instance is not a reason to abstract.**
`max_sync_index_ms` was parsed into a field nothing read, and `DefaultConfig`'s comment described
behaviour that does not exist; the specification still claimed session-start indexing was bounded to
it synchronously, which this change makes doubly false by spawning *more* work on that path. Wiring it
up was rejected — a synchronous index in a hook walks back D4 — so it joins `EmbeddingSettings.Retired`
as a warning on `Ignored`, never on `Problems`, because `Problems` clears `IsUsable` and folding a
retired key in would switch off indexing for every config old enough to contain it. That is the same
trap D33 recorded for the vector lane. `IndexingSettings.Retired` is the pattern's second instance and
deliberately shares no code with the first: two lists of key-and-note pairs are not a duplication worth
a base class, and what is actually shared is the rule, which belongs here rather than in an
inheritance hierarchy.

**Five process lessons, all paid for during this change.** A guard must fail for the feature's
*absence*, not merely for its misbehaviour: the first version of the primer test asserted the policy
function and the formatter separately and would have passed while nothing wired them together — it is
now two tests, and the falsification of the delivery half must **not** redden the policy half, or the
policy has been copied into the caller instead of called. *Falsify against a committed tree* extends
one step earlier, to investigation: a claim in the design that a field already existed was checked
against the working tree while it was being edited, so another author's addition read as pre-existing
state. Answer "does X already exist?" against `HEAD`, never against a working copy someone else is in.
And a design constraint must be stated as its reason rather than as its arithmetic: "this type gains
exactly one member" blocked a later fix that never threatened the property the constraint existed to
protect, which was "no second scoping mechanism". A count is not a reason, and the next person hits it
as a wall. Fourth: a guard asserting that a late stage *preserves* something cannot be written when an
earlier stage of the same pass legitimately removes it. The drain guard asserted that pathless queue
entries survive the discard step, which they cannot, because the invoked root consumes them two calls
earlier; the property is real and is guarded one tier down, where it is observable. Before writing an
integration assertion about what a stage leaves behind, read what the stages ahead of it already did to
that thing. A falsification must be checked against everything else on the path that produces the same
effect. Guard 12 deleted the `last_root` repair above and stayed green, because `IsEnrolled` stamps the
same column earlier in the same pass — so the arm proved nothing while reading as proof. Deleting the
line under test is necessary and not sufficient: the question is whether anything *else* still delivers
the outcome being asserted. Where two call sites both deliver it, either split the guard so each is
reachable alone (12c) or name both deletions in the arm (12b) — but say which, because a one-line
falsification against a two-stamp property is the failure that looks most like success.

## D68 — A supersession may only be written into a row this replay inserted, and provenance is the only thing that can express that

`backup replay` is additive: it never rewrites or closes a fact the target already
had. That was implemented for fact bodies and not at `FactJournal.Link`, the one site that writes to an
existing row. `Link` sets `superseded_by` and never `valid_to` — `Insert` writes that from the journal — so a
supersession applied to a **live** target produces a row simultaneously live and superseded, a state
`ux_fact_live` does not constrain because it is partial on `valid_to IS NULL`; and `FactTokenIndex.Remove`
then fires unconditionally, stripping a live fact from an index that holds live facts only while `fact_fts`
keeps it. Applied to an **already-superseded** target it overwrites `fact.superseded_by` while the
`supersession` insert's `ON CONFLICT(old_fact_id) DO NOTHING` preserves the original, leaving two records of
one relationship that contradict each other — the two halves of one operation disagreeing about idempotency.

**The guard cannot be written as a row-state predicate, and the reason is the whole decision.** The obvious
`WHERE valid_to IS NOT NULL AND superseded_by IS NULL` admits every row provenance admits *plus* pre-existing
rows closed with `superseded_by` NULL — which is the recorded shape of a `Forget`, closed with no
replacement, and there is no other shape a retraction has. Writing there converts a retraction into a
supersession and fabricates a `supersession` row for a replacement that never happened, counted as success
rather than conflict. A replay-inserted row and a forgotten row are structurally identical, so no predicate
over row state separates them. The predicate is kept on the `UPDATE` as an assertion, but the test targets
provenance: implement the predicate *instead* and the forgotten-row test reddens, which is how it was
accepted.

The rule was already in the file. `FactJournal.cs:355` says an absent `idMap` entry must make a supersession
"come out as unresolved rather than aimed at some other row" — an entry means *this replay wrote that row*.
The `Existing()` branch created entries from a **match** instead, and pass 2 fed those to `Link`. That branch
now obeys the comment the other branch already had.

**Presence and address are two questions, and `Existing()` answered both with one `LIMIT 1` and no
`ORDER BY`.** Where the target holds duplicate `(subject, predicate, body, valid_from)` tuples — reachable,
and measured once in 401 rows under two concurrent `index --apply --full` runs — the row returned was
whichever the B-tree handed back. Presence must stay YES on ambiguity: `WouldDisplaceALiveBelief` is live-only
for the same partial-index reason, so a closed-duplicate pair with no live member does not trip it, and
suppressing presence would insert a third copy, then a fourth, unbounded on every replay. The **address** is
where ambiguity bites: exactly one live match is a basis (a supersession names the belief currently held, and
at most one duplicate can be live), while several closed matches give none — `f.id ASC` there is
arbitrary-but-deterministic, which is still arbitrary, and a deterministic wrong address is worse than none
because it reads as a decision. All-closed ambiguity withholds the `idMap` entry and comes out `unresolved`,
which already means the pointer was lost.

A declined link is classified into the buckets that exist rather than a new counter — anything other than
the intended target is `Conflicted` — and an idempotent one is **not counted at all**. Every fact reaching
that branch was already counted `AlreadyPresent` in pass 1, by construction, since pass 2's only resolvable
`idMap` entries come from an `Existing()` match or from `Insert`; so the increment could never occur on its
own, and a counter whose increment cannot occur independently of another is not measuring a distinct thing.
The conflict increment is kept precisely because it is not redundant: pass 1 saw a body that was present and
could not see that the target disagrees about the edge. A record counted `AlreadyPresent` and `Conflicted`
is therefore intended and honest — the body was already there, the edge was not recovered — and it is the
established shape, since `Unresolved` has always been a per-edge count riding beside a per-fact one. Pass
1's `AlreadyPresent` is not decremented to compensate: it is a true statement about the body, and a report
that withdraws it sends someone to restore a snapshot they do not need. The rule is that **no increment may
restate what another increment for the same record already said**. The first version of this ruling counted
the idempotent link `AlreadyPresent`, and a pre-existing test caught it: a 2-record journal replayed twice
reported 3 already present, which the CLI prints as "leaving 3 already in the store".

Duplicate tuples are `fact` rows, so by D8 `repair` may never delete one: the duplicates are permanent, and
this change makes replay survive them rather than removing them.

Design and rulings: `docs/backup-replay-supersession-spec.md`.

## D69 — Repo-index remediation: dry-run silence, where suppression state lives, and what a falsification has to reproduce

**A dry run emits no telemetry at all.** `engram repo index --all` without `--apply` brackets
nothing: the `started`/`finished`/`failed` triple in `RepoCommand.IndexAll` is gated on `apply`,
and all three are gated *together*, because a `failed` with no matching `started` breaks the
reports-both-ends contract that D55 exists to provide — anything displaying activity has to know
when to stop displaying it. The alternative on the table was to keep emitting and exclude
`telemetry.jsonl` from the tier-3 snapshot that asserts a dry run writes nothing. That was
rejected twice over. First on D56's reasoning: `index` is the kind a reader consults to answer
whether automatic indexing is running, and folding a run that did nothing into it inflates that
answer in the direction that looks like success — the same defect D43 traced a wrong conclusion
back to. Second on what the snapshot is *for*: `Snapshot` enumerates every file under the home
and filters nothing, which is the whole of its value, because it catches writes its author never
anticipated. Carving out one filename does not exempt one write, it removes that file from
coverage permanently, for every future writer. A separate `index-dry-run` kind was also rejected,
on D56's other half — a kind that is declared and never read is a feature that reads as switched
off.

The guard that holds this had to be strengthened before it guarded anything: as first written it
ran against zero enrolled repos, so the loop body never executed and it would have stayed green
with `--apply` ignored entirely. It now seeds a repo that `RepoFreshness.Due` actually returns.
Measured on the published binary with the gate removed: `telemetry.jsonl` 1327 → 2216 bytes under
a supposed no-op. That number is the acceptance, not the passing test.

**Deletion-suppression state lives on `repo_registry`; `last_full_scan_at` stays on
`repo_enrollment`.** The distinction is what keeps the two tables apart and it is not cohesion.
`last_full_scan_at` is the scheduler's due-ness clock, so it is a property of a decision the user
made — no enrollment, no schedule, nothing to record. `last_scan_suppressed_reason` describes the
integrity of the index that *recall* reads: a truncated scan means `CodeIndexer` skipped
deletions (D53), so `file_state` holds rows for files that are gone, and recall serves them. That
harm is identical whether or not anyone enrolled the repository, and it is reachable without
enrollment through `engram index --apply <path>`, which registers a repo and indexes it while
`repo_enrollment` stays empty.

Keyed to enrollment the failure was silent at *both* ends, which is worse than it first reads. The
write was a bare `UPDATE repo_enrollment SET … WHERE identity = $identity`: for a registered but
unenrolled repo it matched zero rows and returned success, so nothing was recorded — and
`Diagnostics.CheckRepo` enumerates through `repo_registry`, so nothing was reported either. Doctor
answered `Ok` about a store whose index it had not checked.

Rejected: upserting an enrollment row so the write lands. It corrupts the population that drives
the offer hook and the due-candidate list — manufacturing enrollment rows for repositories the
user never decided about — and `state`'s CHECK constraint has no value meaning *undecided*, so the
fix would have had to invent one. A cheap repair that falsifies the table's meaning is not cheap.

**`CheckRepo` tolerates a missing column and a missing table through one catch.** Doctor opens
with `EngramDatabase.Open` and never `OpenInitialized`, precisely so it can say *your store is a
schema behind* rather than performing the answer (D37, D31) — so it can be pointed at any older
schema. A pre-v8 store lacks `last_scan_suppressed_reason` and repos still enumerate with
suppression unknown; a store predating the repository index lacks `repo_registry` entirely and the
check cannot run at all. Both arrive as `SqliteException`, and the catch matches `no such column`
or `no such table`. It may **not** match on `SqliteErrorCode` alone: that statement is a constant
in our own source, so a typo in it would be swallowed into a permanent silent "not applicable" —
the identical failure to the one being fixed, arriving through a different door.

Neither absence is `Broken` and both exit 0: a store a schema behind is not a fault and the next
ordinary open migrates it, and a doctor that reports red for a supported state is one people learn
to stop reading (D37). Neither may render as a clean bill of health either — the row states why
the check could not run, in both the `Ok` branch and the truncated-scan `Warn` branch, since a
check reporting fine when it could not execute is how a person learns the row means nothing.

**Stamping the scan and clearing the suppression reason are one transaction, and the non-atomic
path was deleted rather than merely left unused.** Two commits meant a crash between them left a
stale reason against a completed scan, which reads as suppression that is not happening.
`RepoEnrollment.StampFullScan` now takes a caller-supplied transaction, and the auto-committing
3-arg overload — by then reachable only from its own tests — was removed rather than kept for
convenience. A path nothing in production drives, held alive by the tests that drive it, is the
same defect as a guard that cannot fail; requiring the transaction makes the unsafe form
unreachable instead of merely unpopular.

**A falsification must reproduce the defect's failure *mode*, not merely produce a failure.** D60
already records the too-quiet half — a break spelling `·` as a bare `.` matches one byte against
two, silently no-ops, and the suite stays green, a falsification reporting success while proving
nothing. This series bought the mirrored half, and it is the more seductive error because the
tests do go red.

The worked example: to prove that the new registered-but-never-enrolled guard catches the
enrollment-keyed regression, the write was re-pointed at `repo_enrollment`. Five of six tests
failed, not the predicted one — because the column had by then *moved*, so the statement threw
`no such column` on every call. What that run demonstrated is that six tests notice an exception.
The original defect was a silent zero-row UPDATE returning success, and whether the new test
caught *that* was still entirely unproven. The valid break keeps the statement where the column
exists and restores the enrollment gate that was the actual bug —
`… WHERE identity = $identity AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM repo_enrollment WHERE identity =
$identity)` — silent, enrollment-gated, no exception. Re-run: exactly one test red, with
`Expected: Warn, Actual: Ok`, which is the silent mode itself. Too loud invalidates an arm as
surely as too quiet, and a break louder than the defect converts a real guard into an
exception-detector nobody asked for.

**Tier-3 results are not evidence while sessions share `./out`.** `EndToEndBinary` falls back to
`./out/engram`, so a concurrent `dotnet publish` from another session rewrites the binary
underneath a running suite. Observed: 11 failures spanning hooks, server lifecycle, installer and
plugin commands; a retry in which only 2 failed, with entirely different errors and two *different*
tests newly failing; and `a native dependency did not survive the install`, which is the llama.cpp
natives (D45) being republished mid-run. Non-determinism spread across unrelated classes with a
shared publish target is that signature. Re-run at a clean HEAD in an isolated worktree against a
private publish: 77/77 of the same tests, and 183/183 for the full tier with the change applied.

The near-miss is the part worth keeping. Several of those failures read `engram exited but its
output pipes never closed`, which is the exact wording of a defect this repo has already paid for
once — a detached maintenance child inheriting the hook's stdout, where a pipe reaches EOF only
when its last writer closes. Filing that as flakiness would have buried a known-live failure mode
under an environmental excuse. A contaminated tier-3 run is not merely unreliable; it is
*confusing*, because it produces symptoms that impersonate real bugs.

**The shape behind most of this series, stated once because it recurred at every layer: a correct
branch or check wired to a population that cannot vary in the case it exists to catch.** The
dry-run guard iterating zero candidates. Every enrollment test calling `Enroll` first, so the
unenrolled path was untested by construction. The suppression write keyed to a table whose row may
not exist. A doctor test dropping a table no code path reads. A required message nothing asserts —
found because an implementor reported, as evidence a change was safe, that no test covered it.
That report is the finding, not the clearance: whatever can be edited freely can be deleted
silently with the suite green. Each of these passes. None of them can fail. The only reliable
detector is to break the thing and watch the red, which is why every guard in this series was
accepted on its falsification and not on its result.

## D70 — Code edges are object-bearing facts; the `edge` table's design is superseded

Argument, in the plan's style: the `edge` table (schema:206-217) was designed with `created_at` and
no `valid_to`/`superseded_by`, making it a snapshot — the same limitation this project rejected in
the tool it was compared against, and incompatible with a store whose entire thesis is that beliefs
have validity windows. `fact.subject_id` + `predicate` + `fact.object_id` is already a directed
typed edge and inherits temporality, supersession, provenance, and the regenerable/protected
distinction for free. Building `edge` as designed would have meant a second, non-temporal
representation of the same relation, and two representations of one thing diverge the first time
one is tuned.

What it costs, stated plainly: `ux_fact_live` becomes two disjoint partial indexes, because adding
`object_id` to the existing one is silently wrong — SQL treats NULLs as distinct, so every ordinary
belief would stop superseding its predecessor with nothing erroring. The invariant that makes the
pair compose is that **a predicate is either always object-bearing or never**, enforced by lint.
The table stays in the schema, unused and marked, rather than being dropped.

## D71 — M3 opens by owner override, and D6's gate is recorded unmet

Argument: D6 gates M3 on evidence that missed recalls are substantially code-structure questions —
a question about *model* behaviour, arising from the observation that every predecessor died
because the LLM never called the memory tool. A direct user request is evidence of user demand, not
of model adoption, and recording it as satisfying D6 would corrupt a gate in the direction that
looks like success — the failure mode D43 traced a wrong conclusion back to.

So the gate is recorded **unmet and overridden by the product owner**, which is legitimate and
different. Two things reduce the risk and are part of the decision: D6's stated rationale cites
"the D1 sidecar risk", which is retired — `src/Engram.Sidecar.Roslyn/` exists, works, and is
tested — so M3 is cheaper than when it was costed; and the override is made answerable rather than
blind, because Phase 1 ships a navigation surface for a fraction of M3's cost and instruments it,
producing the adoption evidence D6 wanted from the cheap end of the work.

Recorded consequence: if `navigate` telemetry after a reasonable period shows the model does not
reach for the surface, that is D6's answer arriving late, and Phases 3–4 should be re-argued rather
than continued on momentum.

## D72 — A code edge names its target; it does not address it

Argument: `object_id` on a code edge holds a **name-keyed symbol entity — the callee as written at
the call site** — and never a resolved declaration. Cross-file resolution is therefore a query-time
join, not stored state.

The alternative that looks obvious is to resolve at index time and store the resolved target, so
traversal is a cheap indexed join. It fails on engram's own incrementality: the blob-SHA skip
(`CodeIndexer.cs:234`) never revisits an unchanged file, so when a symbol moves, every caller's
edge points at the old address and **no caller's file changed** — nothing re-resolves them. The
graph rots in precisely the situation navigation is most wanted, a refactor.

A hybrid — store the resolved target *and* the name, treat staleness as D8-repairable derived
state — was considered and rejected on storage shape rather than on instinct. The append-only
invariant lists **object** among immutable belief content, so a resolved target baked into
`object_id` cannot be repaired; it can only be churned through supersession, manufacturing belief
revisions for an event nobody observed.

The split that resolves it: the edge is *observed belief content* — this caller calls something
spelled `Foo` — which never rots and changes only when the caller's own file changes, which is
exactly when the indexer revisits it. The name→declaration binding is *derived state*, so it lives
in a join and is recomputable by definition. This dissolves the rot rather than mitigating it: a
moved symbol yields correct answers on the next query with no re-index and no repair pass.

Costs accepted: ambiguity is paid per query and is **reported, never resolved by preference** — a
name binding to several declarations returns all of them marked ambiguous, because picking one by
ranking would make navigation a relevance question. Note the asymmetry, which cuts the other way
from the intuition that query-time resolution is slower: `callers(X)` needs no join at all, only a
lookup of facts whose `object_id` is `X`'s name entity, and that is the direction most often asked.
Only `callees` joins.

Uniformity is the corroborating argument: `imports` objects are name-keyed module strings already,
so this is the substrate's general rule and not a special case for `calls`. A name→declaration side
index in the `fact_token` style is deliberately deferred, gated on measured edge volume and a
timing rather than a plan (D60).

## D73 — Engram tool calls are observed in hook space, so attribution needs no join

D43 left "which Claude Code sessions ever called `engram_remember`" uncomputable: `remember`
records carry the transport's `Mcp-Session-Id`, `session-start` carries Claude Code's, and no value
appears in both. The fix is not a join — the client never forwards its id — but a second observer.
`PostToolUse` fires on MCP tools by name, in the hook's own id space, so a hook matched on
`mcp__plugin_engram_engram__.*` writes one `tool-observed` record per Engram tool call, with the
tool's short name as `tool` and the payload's `agent_id`/`agent_type`, under the same session id
`session-start`, `pre-compact` and `post-compact` already use. Every per-session question about
memory use becomes a filter over one id space — once records exist. At the time of writing none do:
the hook entry ships with the plugin and the verb with the binary, and the matcher has not yet fired
in a live session. **Nobody may read a `tool-observed` number until one live record has been seen
whose `session_id` matches that session's `session-start`.**

Two ceilings, recorded rather than fixed. `Telemetry.Append` is best-effort under contention — D55
measured 30% loss inside the full test suite at the 500 ms budget — so N2's "share of sessions with
zero remembers" is an **upper bound**: a non-zero count is trustworthy, a zero on its own is not
proof of absence. And `EngramToolPrefix` strips `mcp__plugin_engram_engram__engram_`, so an Engram
tool not named `engram_*` would silently not match; all eight tools today carry the prefix, and the
matcher in `hooks.json` is wider than the verb's check on purpose, so widening the verb is the whole
fix if that ever changes.

Three shapes were rejected. Folding it into the `remember`/`recall` kinds would double D18/D43's
counts, since the server already writes one record per call. Minting a session id when the payload
has none would produce exactly the unjoinable row the kind exists to remove, so a missing id writes
nothing. And a `TimeSpan.Zero` retry budget was not copied from `file-touched`: that hook fires per
edit and holds a 10 ms budget; this one fires per Engram tool call (~60/day) and takes the default.
It never opens the database — the whole point is that a session's tool use becomes countable from
the log alone. This is measurement only: the observer decides nothing and emits no output, and any
