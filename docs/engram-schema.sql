-- ENGRAM — canonical schema, version 1
--
-- This file is the authority for M1's database shape. It implements the spec's
-- section 4.1 with the amendments recorded as D2, D3, and D9 in
-- docs/engram-implementation-plan.md. Where it departs from the spec, the reason
-- is stated inline.
--
-- Invariants the schema itself enforces, rather than trusting code to maintain:
--   * a fact is closed at most once            (supersession PK on old_fact_id)
--   * at most one live fact per subject+predicate  (unique partial index)
--   * the lexical index holds live facts only  (triggers, not application code)
--   * no fact can reference a subject that does not exist  (foreign keys ON)
--   * provenance is one of exactly three tiers, and regenerability is a
--     separate boolean, so the two can never be conflated  (CHECK constraints)

-- Persistent. journal_mode is written into the database header and survives, so
-- setting it here is enough.
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;

-- CONNECTION-SCOPED, NOT PERSISTENT. The three pragmas below apply only to the
-- connection that runs them — including the one applying this file. They are
-- listed here for completeness, but setting them here does NOT configure the
-- database. Every connection Engram opens must set them itself, in one shared
-- open routine:
--
--     PRAGMA synchronous  = NORMAL;
--     PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
--     PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;
--
-- foreign_keys is the one with teeth: SQLite the engine defaults it OFF, so a
-- connection that forgets it loses every foreign-key guarantee in this file
-- silently, with no error at any point. Verified against the sqlite3 CLI: an
-- UPDATE writing superseded_by = 2 while fact 2 did not exist was accepted.
--
-- Measured caveat, so nobody mistakes what is holding the line: the provider we
-- actually use, Microsoft.Data.Sqlite, already sends `PRAGMA foreign_keys = 1`
-- when it opens. A raw connection through it reads back fk=1, busy=0, sync=2,
-- journal=delete. So of the three pragmas, only busy_timeout and synchronous are
-- doing work our code has to do; setting foreign_keys ourselves is insurance
-- against a connection string that says `Foreign Keys=False`, or a swap to a
-- provider without the courtesy. Keep it — the cost is one statement and the
-- failure it prevents is silent — but do not expect deleting it to break a test.
--
-- Three integration tests guard this (D9): one asserting `PRAGMA foreign_keys`
-- reads back 1 on a freshly opened connection, one asserting a dangling
-- reference is rejected through the real open path, and one on busy_timeout,
-- which is the one that genuinely fails when the open routine stops setting it.
--
-- busy_timeout pairs with BEGIN IMMEDIATE on every write (D4). A deferred
-- transaction that later upgrades to a writer raises SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT, which
-- busy_timeout cannot wait out — the WAL footgun the discipline exists to avoid.
PRAGMA synchronous  = NORMAL;
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;

-- (MoveSubtree) that rewrites entity.path and fact.path in a single transaction
-- and files the old path in entity_alias.

-- Lexical lane (D3): external-content FTS5 over LIVE facts only.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- External content, not contentless: the 'delete' command needs the previously
-- indexed column values, and external content has them by construction. Facts
-- are never hard-deleted outside `compact`, so the content table cannot dangle.
--
-- Live-only is deliberate. Superseded facts occupying seed_k slots before the
-- live filter would pollute ranking. History search is rare and served by a scan
-- over closed facts.
--
-- subject_name is absent by necessity — external content can only index columns
-- that exist on the content table. `path` carries the subject anyway: it is the
-- denormalized subject path (D2), it lives on this table, and unicode61 splits
-- it on / and - into the same words the name is made of.
--
-- Indexing it is not cosmetic. Measured on the seeded corpus, 30 of 45 live
-- facts (67%) have at least one subject word that appears nowhere in their body,
-- across 39 such words. Without `path` here those words are reachable only by
-- the literal-token lane, so any morphological variant of them — most often a
-- plural — matches nothing at all.
--
-- Columns are weighted equally by bm25, which is the honest default rather than
-- a measured one. `path` is short, so a hit in it is not cheap to earn; the root
-- and topic segments repeat across every fact and are therefore nearly free of
-- IDF, which is what keeps "/knowledge" from matching the whole store.
