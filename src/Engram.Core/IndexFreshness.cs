/// <para><b>Why a poll, and why <c>repo_enrollment</c> rather than the spool queue.</b> The queue
/// only ever sees edits a <c>PostToolUse</c> hook observed, which is exactly what D67 was written
/// against — a <c>git pull</c>, a rebase, or a branch switch made outside any tool call never
/// enters it. Freshness is a time question and <c>last_full_scan_at</c> is the time record, so this
/// loop asks <see cref="RepoFreshness.NextDue"/> — the same selection policy items 2 and 3 use —
/// rather than growing a private notion of "due".</para>
///
/// <para><b>One repo per tick, same reasoning as the session-start self-heal.</b> A tick that
/// services every due repo is an unbounded pass wearing a bounded costume; one per tick makes
/// worst-case work per unit time constant, and <c>RepoFreshness</c>'s most-neglected-first ordering
/// makes it converge across repos rather than starving one.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Ambient, never commanded.</b> Nothing is waiting on this loop — a newly enrolled repo
/// already gets its own spawn and a session that touches a repo already gets item 3 — so lock
/// contention (§6.4) is handled the same way <c>index --freshen</c> handles it: silently, moving on
/// to whatever the next tick finds due.</para>
