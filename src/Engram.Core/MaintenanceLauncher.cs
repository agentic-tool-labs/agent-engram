/// <para><b>Why a child at all.</b> A snapshot is a <c>VACUUM INTO</c> over the whole store — tens
/// of milliseconds today and more as the store grows, against a hook that has a budget. Doing it
/// inline would put an unbounded operation on the path of every session start. Forking costs the
/// parent one <c>fork</c>/<c>exec</c> and nothing else: it never waits, never reads the child's
/// output, and does not care whether the child succeeded.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why session start.</b> It is the moment that correlates with facts about to be written,
/// and the moment a person is not waiting on a result. A timer would need a daemon that is not
/// always running — hooks write facts whether or not the server is up — and a cron entry would be a
/// second installation surface to own and uninstall (D28).</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why both jobs share one fork.</b> The queue compaction has the same shape as the
/// snapshot: unbounded in principle, cheap in the common case, and nobody is waiting on it. Giving
/// it a second <see cref="Process.Start"/> would double the one cost the parent actually pays to
/// save nothing, since the children run detached either way. Each job carries its own
/// already-cheap-when-idle guard — <c>--if-due</c> and <c>--if-large</c> — so this can stay
/// unconditional and not grow a policy of its own.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why the redirection is on the shell and not on the group.</b> A child inheriting a
/// piped stdout holds that pipe open, and a reader of the parent's output waits for an EOF that
/// only the last writer can give. <c>ServerLauncher</c> escapes this by <c>exec</c>-ing its one
/// command, so no shell remains; this runs several commands and cannot, and the adaptation that
/// wrote <c>{ … } >/dev/null</c> instead lost the property it was adapting — the group's
/// descriptors were replaced and the shell's were not, so <c>/bin/sh</c> sat holding the pipe for
/// as long as the slowest job took. Measured on the published binary as the difference between
/// timing the hook through a pipe and through a file, which is exactly that wait:
/// <b>+76.6 ms at 5,308 live facts and +44.0 ms at 50,097</b>, against <b>+0.4 ms</b> for
/// <c>subagent-start</c>, which builds the same primer and forks nothing. With <c>exec</c> the
/// same measurement reads −0.2 and −0.1 ms. This was never a harness artifact: Claude Code reads
/// this hook's stdout to receive the primer, so every session start was waiting on the backup,
/// the queue compaction, the token repair and <c>index --drain</c> — the whole of what detaching
/// exists to avoid. With it gone the fork costs the parent 1.6–3.3 ms, which is what the class
/// always claimed.</para>
