/// <para>The old store kept one file per statement with its own <c>supersedes</c> and
/// <c>retracts</c> pointers — a second implementation of the validity window <c>fact</c> already
/// had (see <see cref="UserFacts"/>). Nothing in the current code reads that directory, so an
/// instance upgraded across the change keeps its files and loses its memory. This converts them
/// rather than reimplementing the reader, and hands the result to
/// <see cref="FactJournal.Replay"/>, which is already additive, idempotent, and tested.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Addresses come from <see cref="UserFacts"/>, not from here.</b> A migrated statement
/// has to land where a natively captured one would, or the same sentence typed again tomorrow
/// would create a second live fact beside its own history. That means the path leaf is
/// <see cref="FactStore.Fingerprint"/> of the text, which is also why this is C# rather than a
/// throwaway script: reimplementing that hash elsewhere would agree until it did not.</para>
///
/// <para><b>A chain shares one address.</b> The old model linked a restatement to its predecessor
/// by id, so the two texts differ and would fingerprint to different entities — writing both
/// would leave two live facts where the user meant one belief that changed. So every member of a
/// chain is addressed at its root's path and predicate, which is exactly what
/// <see cref="UserFacts.Restate"/> does for a live one, and the supersession is expressed the way
/// the store expresses it rather than by a pointer only this file understands.</para>
