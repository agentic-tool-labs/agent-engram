/// <para><b>The defaults exclude when unsure, and that asymmetry is the whole design.</b> A file
/// wrongly indexed becomes facts, and facts are append-only — <c>compact</c> and <c>repair</c> are
/// forbidden from deleting a fact body (D8), and nothing downstream can tell a fact derived from a
/// minified bundle from one derived from real source. So the only cure for a bad include is
/// <c>forget</c>, by hand, after the noise has already been served to a model. A bad exclude costs
/// one line of config and a re-index.</para>
///
/// <para>Every skip is counted and reported rather than silent, so an over-eager rule shows up as
/// a number in <c>doctor</c> instead of as a repo that mysteriously has no code facts.</para>

/// Settings Engram itself once wrote here and no longer reads, described. Kept apart from
