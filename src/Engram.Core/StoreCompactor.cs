/// Without <c>--path</c> it prunes closed regenerable facts — superseded index history,

/// subtree, live rows included: the detached-repo case, where the source is gone and the
/// facts describe files nobody can open.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>A regenerable fact that shares a supersession edge with an authored fact is
/// excluded in both directions: revising a code fact into a belief, or correcting a belief
/// with one, makes the pair part of authored history, and deleting either half leaves the
/// survivor explaining a revision nobody can read.</para>
///
/// <para>Path mode also clears <c>file_state</c> for every file the prefix touches, and that
/// is load-bearing rather than tidy: pruned facts with surviving file state would make the
/// next index run see unchanged blob hashes and rewrite nothing — a silent, permanent loss.
/// A file's state goes when its facts go <em>or</em> when the prefix names something inside
/// it, because either way the file must be re-read to be whole again.</para>
///
/// <para>Deleting a closed fact requires schema version 3: the version 2 delete trigger
/// re-deleted an FTS entry <c>fact_fts_close</c> had already removed, and FTS5 fails the
