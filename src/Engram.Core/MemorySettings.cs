/// carrying a second memory system it was told about somewhere Engram cannot see — Claude Code's
/// file-based memory is one, and its instructions are longer, more specific, and carry a literal
/// trigger ("if the user asks you to remember something, save it immediately"). Engram had no
/// equivalent claim anywhere the top-level agent could read: the write instruction existed only in
/// the subagent primer, which reads as extending a baseline that was never stated. Faced with one
/// instruction that fires on the user's exact words and one that does not mention writing at all,
/// the agent correctly followed the first. Fixing that in <c>engram_remember</c>'s own description
/// is not a preference and ships unconditionally. Declaring somebody else's memory system
/// subordinate is a preference, because the files already in it are the user's and Engram did not
/// put them there — so that half is this key, and <see cref="MemoryPrecedence.EngramFirst"/> is the
/// default because it corrects the ranking without silently disabling a system in use.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why the primer carries it rather than a tool description.</b> Descriptions are
/// <c>[Description]</c> attributes — compile-time constants, identical for every install, so a
/// per-user setting cannot reach them. The primer is the only channel that is both configurable and
/// durable: SessionStart matches <c>startup|resume|clear|compact</c>, so it is re-injected at every
/// point where context was reset, including after each compaction. That is weaker than the system
/// prompt, which never decays, and the honest limit of this approach — between compactions the line
/// is ordinary context and fades like any other.</para>
