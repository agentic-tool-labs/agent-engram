/// <summary>
/// The one place vectors are produced: a loop that drains the backfill queue for as long as the
/// server is up.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Why one, and why here.</b> A model is resident and expensive — a second process
/// loading one costs its memory again for no more throughput, and two processes embedding the
/// same queue would race to write the same rows. Engram already runs exactly one long-lived
/// process per home, guarded by its pid file, so the singular embedder is not a new daemon with
/// a new lock: it is a loop inside the one that already exists. A hook or a second CLI
/// invocation writes facts and walks away; this is what turns them into vectors.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The contract is eventual, and deliberately so.</b> <c>remember</c> returns as soon
/// as the fact is durable. It never waits on an embedding, because the write path may not
/// depend on a model being loaded, reachable, or correct (D4, D18) — a fact stated to an agent
/// must land even with the endpoint down. So a new fact is lexically searchable immediately and
/// becomes semantically searchable when this loop next runs. The queue is a query over
/// <c>fact</c>, so nothing is lost in between: a crash, a restart, or a week with embeddings
/// switched off leaves exactly the same work to do, and no bookkeeping to reconcile.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Idle is the common case.</b> A poll that costs a COUNT over a LEFT JOIN is cheap,
/// but not free forever, so the interval backs off when there is nothing to do and snaps back
/// the moment there is. That keeps a fact written during a busy session waiting seconds rather
/// than a fixed worst case, without a wakeup a minute on a machine nobody is using.</para>
