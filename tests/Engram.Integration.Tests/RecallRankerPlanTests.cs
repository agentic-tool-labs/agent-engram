/// Spec §3.2: the primary guard on the SQL ranker, not a timing test. Pins the properties that

/// text was written ("pin reality, not a hope") — not the properties hoped for.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>What is NOT asserted, and why.</b> Spec §3.2's literal text says "no SCAN of
/// <c>fact</c> anywhere in the plan." Captured reality, at both a 5-fact sandbox and a 50,000-fact
/// synthetic corpus (both with <c>ANALYZE</c>), is that this does not hold for the statement as
/// spec §2.3 literally specifies it — two sites scan <c>fact</c>:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><c>prior_sessions</c> materializes via <c>SCAN f USING INDEX ix_fact_session</c>. Every
/// rewrite of its path filter tried here — <c>substr(e.path,...)</c> through the entity join (as
/// spec §2.4 literally writes it), <c>substr(f.path,...)</c> against the denormalized column
/// directly, and <c>f.path LIKE '/sessions/%'</c> — produced the identical scan, at both a
/// realistic 49,950:50 long-term:session mix and an all-session corpus. The planner is choosing
/// <c>ix_fact_session</c> for the <c>DISTINCT ... ORDER BY session_id</c> it needs regardless of
/// the path predicate's selectivity, not failing to use an index — there does not appear to be a
/// query-text-only fix, and ruling 6 requires ranging over the *entire* prior-session set, which is
/// what this scan is doing. Reported as a spec-level finding, not fixed here.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para>A second exception, <c>SCAN f2</c> from the <c>versions</c> correlated subquery, was on
/// this list and has been removed because it was fixed rather than accepted. It was raised here as
/// a call for the spec's author, and the measurement that answered it found the scan was not a
/// tolerable cost but <b>93–99% of the entire ranking statement</b>, at every corpus size and every
/// match count: on the 50,097-fact store a term matching 45,132 facts cost 1,545 ms, of which 105 ms
/// remained with the subquery removed, and 5,308 facts cost 31.8 ms against 1.0 ms. The escalation
/// offered one fix — substitute the denormalized <c>fact.path</c> for <c>entity.path</c> — and
/// correctly declined to make that trade, since <c>fact.path</c> is derived state with a rename
/// staleness window (D8). <c>ix_fact_thread</c> is a third option that costs nothing on either side:
/// it changes which rows are <i>found</i>, never which are counted, so <c>entity.path</c> stays the
/// authority and the plan becomes an indexed search. The index is not redundant with
/// <c>ux_fact_live</c> despite naming the same two columns — that one is partial on
/// <c>valid_to IS NULL</c>, and a thread length counts closed rows too, which is the whole reason
/// the planner could not use it.</para>
/// <para>Asserting the literal §3.2 text here would either fail permanently for a property this
/// implementation did not regress (it followed §2.3's literal SQL), or silently paper over two real
/// findings by weakening the assertion without saying so. Both are worse than naming the two
/// exceptions explicitly and asserting the rest.</para>
