    // Measured 6,263 characters across the eleven tools in EngramMcpTools on 2026-08-24, when
    // engram_navigate joined for code navigation (docs/code-navigation-spec.md §3.4): defined_at
    // and imports are a deterministic lookup RecallRanker cannot answer (navigation is not a
    // relevance question), so they need their own tool rather than a parameter on engram_recall.
    // This is the deliberate-feature-addition case the ceiling exists to let through, not the
    // silent-drift case it otherwise guards against, so it is re-baselined off this measured
    // actual rather than carrying forward unspent headroom. Re-baselined again same day, 6,263 ->
    // 6,281, after a reviewer fixup pass folded `limit`'s clamp range into its own description.
    // EngramServerTools's three tools (start/status/stop) are argued as cost in D17 but are
    // not reflected over by ToolMethods() and are not counted in this figure — a separate,
    // unmeasured gap. Raising this number is a deliberate edit that needs a reason in the
    // commit message, not a knob to turn when a description outgrows it.
    //
    // Re-baselined 6,281 -> 6,443 when engram_navigate gained implements/implementers/members
    // (docs/specs/close-graph-query-gap.md §2/§8): three new relations answering questions
    // Grep gets wrong (inheritance, interface implementation, type members) are worth the
    // description cost the same way defined_at/imports were.
    //
    // Re-baselined 6,443 -> 6,550 (§11.1, Architect ruling): the nested-type-drop caveat moved
    // out of a per-result note that fired on ~100% of implements/implementers/members results
    // (a constant, not a discriminator — D37 says a banner is read as noise) and into this
    // static description instead, which is sent once per turn rather than once per matching
    // result. Net cost per session goes down; this ceiling only measures the one-time cost.
